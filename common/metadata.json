Unlike US dollars that you can hold in your hand (or in your bank account), there is no central authority or centralized payment system controlling Bitcoin. Instead, Bitcoin operates in a peer-to-peer network that allows anyone in the world to send and receive Bitcoin without any middleman (like a bank, central bank or payment processor).\r\n\r\nAlthough there are thousands of cryptocurrencies ranked on CMC today, Bitcoin was the very first cryptocurrency ever created. On Oct. 31, 2008 a person (or group of people) under the pseudonym “Satoshi Nakamoto” published the now-world famous [Bitcoin white paper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf).\r\n\r\nThe first line reads: “A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash, which would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”\r\n\r\nThe Bitcoin network then launched on Jan. 3, 2009, marking the start of the cryptocurrency revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Does Bitcoin Work? \r\n\r\nBitcoin is a purely decentralized digital currency, which makes it unlike any other asset that came before it.\r\n\r\nBefore the digital age, everyone transacted in physical forms of currencies, from livestock and salt, to silver and gold, and finally to banknotes. Only in recent times was money “digitized” — allowing bank accounts to exist online, as well as creating the many online payment processing platforms, such as PayPal and Square, that you often use today without thinking about it.\r\n\r\nHowever, all of these “digital transactions” require a centralized system to operate. Your bank, or financial services like PayPal, needs to ensure that all of their users’ accounts are constantly updated and tallied correctly. These systems represent the centralized form of digital money.\r\n\r\nBitcoin revolutionized digital money by decentralizing this accounting process. Instead of a central figure that is responsible for making sure that their users’ transactions were always adding up, Bitcoin works by sharing the account balances and transactions of every user across the globe in a pseudonymous form. In simplest terms, this means that anyone can download and run the free and open-source software required to participate in the Bitcoin protocol.\r\n\r\nAs a Bitcoin user, all you need to know to send Bitcoin to someone else is their Bitcoin address (a series of letters and numbers, not their name or any personal information!). By sending your Bitcoin to an address, what you are doing is broadcasting your transaction (Hi, I’m Alice sending 1 BTC to Bob!) across the Bitcoin network using blockchain technology (more about that below). Since the Bitcoin network has the most up-to-date ledger tracking Alice’s wallet balance, the system checks her wallet balance (i.e., Alice has 2 BTC in her wallet, so a transaction of 1 BTC to Bob is valid), and then completes the transaction.\r\n\r\nIn summary, Bitcoin works by ensuring that this shared ledger always tallies up, and that new Bitcoin transactions (Bob sends 2 BTC back to Alice. Go Alice!) are validated, recorded and then added to the ledger in order. That is the heart of blockchain technology, where new “blocks of information” are added to the chain of blocks that already exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Does Bitcoin Mining Work? \r\n\r\n“Mining” refers to the act of adding new blocks to the blockchain. In simple terms, Bitcoin miners dedicate significant amounts of computing power to solve a cryptographic problem, which is basically a very complex puzzle. The successful miner that solves the puzzle before all the other miners gets rewarded with a “block reward,” which is an allocation of a predetermined number of Bitcoin. In some cases, the block rewards are awarded to mining pools, when miners group together to share resources.\r\n\r\nOnce the puzzle is solved, the block is “confirmed,” and it is added to the blockchain. This new information is sent to all nodes, aka participants in the Bitcoin protocol, and the shared ledger is updated once again.\r\n\r\nAs Bitcoin's price rises, the block reward becomes increasingly more attractive. This incentivizes more miners to join in the competition to mine for blocks. In return, the more miners there are in the system, the more secure the network is. In addition, the increased competition also means miners are continually investing in newer hardware to ensure their computing power remains relevant for the fight for block rewards.\r\n \r\n\r\n### What Is a Bitcoin Halving? \r\n\r\nTo ensure that the value of Bitcoin is not compromised by an infinite supply, Satoshi Nakamoto wrote in a “halving event” that happens every 210,000 blocks. When Bitcoin’s network first began, Bitcoin’s block reward was 50 BTC per block mined. This was halved in 2012, at block #210,000, where the block reward became 25 BTC. The second halving was in 2016, at block #420,000, and the block reward became 12.5 BTC. \r\n\r\nThis process will continue every 210,000 blocks, until the total supply of BTC (21 million BTC) has been reached. It is estimated that the final block reward will be paid in 2140!

Keep it on a Bitcoin exchange\r\n\r\nThere are many Bitcoin different exchanges all over the world. All of these exchanges allow you to sell Bitcoin for other cryptocurrencies (altcoins) or government currencies (USD, EUR, GBP etc.) At the same time, these Bitcoin exchanges allow you to store your BTC with them, which means that the burden of keeping it safe is on them. Do note that incidents have occurred when exchanges have been hacked or lost their customers’ BTC, so do your own research when you’re looking for an exchange that’s safe to hold your cryptoassets.

Keep it in a Bitcoin wallet\r\n\r\nInstead of keeping it on a Bitcoin exchange, you could keep your Bitcoin in a Bitcoin wallet instead. Wallets come in two forms — hot and cold. Hot wallets are software that stays connected to the internet, aka storing your Bitcoin online. It is more convenient to transact via a hot wallet, but they logically are more susceptible to being attacked, as they stay connected to the internet.\r\n\r\nCold wallets are wallets that are not “online.” They are less prone to attack, as hackers cannot access this type of cold storage via the internet, but they are also a lot less convenient for the user as they may be cost-prohibitive and require more technical understanding to operate. Examples of cold wallets are hardware wallets and paper wallets.","links":{"website":["https://bitcoin.org/"],"technical_doc":["https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf"],"twitter":[],"reddit":["https://reddit.com/r/bitcoin"],"message_board":["https://bitcointalk.org"],"announcement":[],"chat":[],"explorer":["https://blockchain.coinmarketcap.com/chain/bitcoin","https://blockchain.info/","https://live.blockcypher.com/btc/","https://blockchair.com/bitcoin","https://explorer.viabtc.com/btc"],"source_code":["https://github.com/bitcoin/"]}},{"id":1027,"coin":"ETH","name":"Ethereum","slug":"ethereum","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/1027.png","description":"### What Is Ethereum?\r\n\r\nEthereum is a smart contract platform that enables developers to build decentralized applications (DApps) on its blockchain. Ether (ETH) is the native digital currency of the Ethereum platform. \r\n\r\nEthereum is supported in part by the Ethereum Foundation, a non-profit that is part of the larger Ethereum ecosystem including enterprise Ethereum consortiums like the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance. \r\n\r\n\r\n### How Does Ethereum Work?\r\n\r\nVitalik Buterin first conceptualized Ethereum in 2013 with the idea of developing an open-source blockchain platform different from Bitcoin (BTC), thus pioneering smart contracts. On the Ethereum blockchain, a smart contract behaves like a self-operating computer program that automatically executes when specific conditions are met. Blockchain allows smart contracts’ code to be run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interference. \r\n\r\nThe Ethereum network went live on July 30, 2015, with 73 million Ether pre-mined. \r\n\r\n\r\n### How Do You Mine Ethereum?\r\n\r\nEthereum mining is currently based on a proof-of-work (PoW) protocol (like Bitcoin), with future plans to switch to proof-of-stake. Ethereum mining works when miners use their computational power to solve a mathematical problem (finding the hash of a block’s unique header metadata). The first miner to successfully solve the problem (find the hash) then broadcasts that the block has been mined to the entire Ethereum network for other nodes to validate and add the block to the blockchain.\r\n\r\nThe Ethereum blockchain was supposed to migrate from a PoW system to the less energy-investive proof-of-stake system (PoS) system in January 2020, but the deadline was not met. A switch to PoS and the release of Ethereum 2.0 is still expected for later in 2020.\r\n\r\nEthereum mining is based on the Ethash algorithm, and ETH miners originally received a block reward of 5 ETH per block when the network first went live. In the end of 2017, the Byzantine hard fork of the Ethereum blockchain lowered the block rewards from 5 ETH to 3 ETH. In early 2019, the reward was again lowered to 2 ETH in what is known as “the thirdening.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ethash proof-of-work protocol makes it not profitable to use ASICs to mine (unlike Bitcoin). Each Ethereum block aims to take an average of 12 seconds to be mined, and the level of difficulty of mining is proportional to the total amount of computer power (or network’s hashrate) being used to mine Ethereum.\r\n\r\nEthereum transactions are called “gas” and they are responsible for powering operations on the entire network, meaning you have to spend your “gas” (Ether) in order to make changes to the blockchain. Ethereum also has a Turing complete internal code.\r\n\r\n\r\n###What Is Ethereum Used For?\r\n\r\nThe Ethereum platform is used by developers to build new kinds of DApps, which can have a variety of uses ranging from the creation of new digital assets and uncensorable web apps to building decentralized autonomous organizations and more. Anyone around the world is able to freely connect to the Ethereum network.\r\n\r\nEther, the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain, is also used as digital money and can be sent to anyone in the world instantly. Ether can be used as a form of payment or a store of value.\r\n\r\n\r\n###How Do You Buy Ethereum?\r\n\r\nIf you are not mining the Ethereum blockchain (which can be prohibitively expensive unless you are a professional miner), you can buy Ethereum on a cryptocurrency exchange.

XRP is the currency that runs on a digital payment platform called RippleNet, which is on top of a distributed ledger database called XRP Ledger. While RippleNet is run by a company called Ripple, the XRP Ledger is open-source and is not based on blockchain, but rather the previously mentioned distributed ledger database.\r\n\r\nThe RippleNet payment platform is a real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system that aims to enable instant monetary transactions globally. While XRP is the cryptocurrency native to the XRP Ledger, you can actually use any currency to transact on the platform.\r\n\r\nWhile the idea behind the Ripple payment platform was first voiced in 2004 by Ryan Fugger, it wasn’t until Jed McCaleb and Chris Larson took over the project in 2012 that Ripple began to be built (at the time, it was also called OpenCoin). \r\n\r\n\r\n###How Does XRP Work?\r\n\r\nXRP was created by Ripple to be a speedy, less costly and more scalable alternative to both other digital assets and existing monetary payment platforms like SWIFT. \r\n\r\nRippleNet’s ledger is maintained by the global XRP Community, with Ripple the company as an active member. The XRP Ledger processes transactions roughly every 3-5 seconds, or whenever independent validator nodes come to a consensus on both the order and validity of XRP transactions — as opposed to proof-of-work mining like Bitcoin (BTC). Anyone can be a Ripple validator, and the list is currently made up of Ripple along with universities, financial institutions and others.\r\n\r\n\r\n###How Do You Buy XRP?\r\n\r\nYou can buy XRP on any exchange that offers the digital currency.

Chainlink was developed by Sergey Nazarov, with Steve Ellis as the other co-founder. It held an ICO in September 2017, raising $32 million, with a total supply of 1 billion LINK tokens.\r\nLINK, the cryptocurrency native to the Chainlink decentralized oracle network, is used to pay node operators. Since the Chainlink network has a reputation system, node providers that have a large amount of LINK can be rewarded with larger contracts, while a failure to deliver accurate information results in a deduction of tokens. Developers describe LINK as “an ERC20 token, with the additional ERC223 'transfer and call' functionality of transfer (address, uint256, bytes), allowing tokens to be received and processed by contracts within a single transaction.” Following the 2017 $32 million LINK ICO, 32 percent of LINK tokens were sent to node operators to incentivize the ecosystem and 30 percent stayed within Chainlink for development (35 percent were sold in the public token sale).\r\n\r\n### What Are Oracles?\r\nChainlink is a platform that aims to bridge the gap between blockchain technology-based smart contracts (made widespread by Ethereum), and real world applications. Since blockchains cannot access data outside their network, oracles (a defi instrument) are needed to function as data feeds in smart contracts. In Chainlink's case, the oracles are connected to the Ethereum network. Oracles provide external data (e.g. temperature, weather) that trigger smart contract executions upon the fulfillment of predefined conditions. Participants on the Chainlink network are incentivized (through rewards) to provide smart contracts with access to external data feeds like API information. Should users desire access to off-chain data, they can submit a requesting contract to Chainlink’s network. These contracts will match the requesting contract with the appropriate oracles. The contracts include a reputation contract, an order-matching contract and an aggregating contract. The aggregating contract gathers data of the selected oracles to find the most accurate result.\r\n \r\n### Where Can You Buy Chainlink?\r\nYou can buy Chainlink (LINK) on any exchange that supports the digital currency.

In the same way that physical money, such as a dollar bill, is handed directly to the person being paid, Bitcoin Cash payments are sent directly from one person to another.\r\n\r\nAs a permissionless, decentralized cryptocurrency, Bitcoin Cash requires no trusted third parties and no central bank. Unlike traditional fiat money, Bitcoin Cash does not depend on monetary middlemen such as banks and payment processors. Transactions cannot be censored by governments or other centralized corporations. Similarly, funds cannot be seized or frozen — because financial third parties have no control over the Bitcoin Cash network. \r\n\r\n### What is Bitcoin Cash used for?\r\n\r\nBitcoin Cash combines gold-like scarcity with the spendable nature of cash. With a limited total supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin Cash is provably scarce and, like physical cash, can be easily spent. Transactions are fast with transaction fees typically less than a tenth of a cent. Anybody can accept Bitcoin Cash payments with a smartphone or computer.\r\n\r\nBitcoin Cash has various use cases. In addition to peer-to-peer payments between individuals, Bitcoin Cash can be used to pay participating merchants for goods and services in-store and online. Very low fees enable new micro-transaction economies, such as tipping content creators and rewarding app users a few cents. Bitcoin Cash also reduces the fees and settlement times for remittances and cross-border trade. Other use cases include tokens, simplified smart contracts, and private payments with tools such as CashShuffle and CashFusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is Bitcoin Cash different from Bitcoin?\r\n\r\nIn 2017, the Bitcoin project and its community split in two over concerns about Bitcoin’s scalability. The result was a hark fork which created Bitcoin Cash, a new cryptocurrency considered by supporters to be the legitimate continuation of the Bitcoin project as [peer-to-peer electronic cash](https://www.bitcoincash.org/bitcoin.pdf). All Bitcoin holders at the time of the fork (block 478,558) automatically became owners of Bitcoin Cash.\r\n\r\nUnlike Bitcoin BTC, Bitcoin Cash aims to scale so it can meet the demands of a global payment system. At the time of the split, the Bitcoin Cash block size was increased from 1MB to 8MB. An increased block size means Bitcoin Cash can now handle significantly more transactions per second (TPS) while keeping fees extremely low, solving the issues of payment delays and high fees experienced by some users on the Bitcoin BTC network. \r\n\r\nDevelopment to further optimize the Bitcoin Cash network continues on the [Bitcoin Cash roadmap](https://www.bitcoincash.org/roadmap.html), led by the Bitcoin ABC full node team. Planned upgrades take place every six months to put into effect the latest network developments. \r\n\r\n### How do you mine Bitcoin Cash?\r\n\r\nMining is the process in which new Bitcoin Cash transactions are confirmed and new blocks are added to the Bitcoin Cash blockchain. Miners use computing power and electricity to solve complex puzzles. By doing so, they gain the ability to produce new blocks of transactions. If one of their blocks is accepted by the network, the miner, or mining pool, earns a block reward in the form of newly-issued Bitcoin Cash. \r\n\r\nMining is highly competitive. As the price of Bitcoin Cash in the marketplace rises, more miners are incentivized to bring more hash rate into the ever-increasing miner competition to produce blocks and have them accepted by the Bitcoin Cash network. More miners make the network more secure by increasing and distributing the hash rate. This prevents a single miner from having control over the network. \r\n\r\nAnyone can mine Bitcoin Cash. Mining requires specialized hardware called mining equipment, which can either be bought or rented. Miners also need to run a full node software (with the majority of miners currently running Bitcoin ABC) to build blocks and connect to the rest of the Bitcoin Cash network. Mining can be done independently but miners often pool their hash rate together and share proportionally in the earned block rewards. \r\n\r\n### How do you buy Bitcoin Cash?\r\n\r\nBitcoin Cash is available at a variety of crypto exchanges, depending on your region.

Hoskinson was also one of the founders of Ethereum.\r\nCardano is reportedly the first blockchain platform to evolve out of a scientific philosophy and a research-first driven approach, and one of the first to be built in the Haskell programming language. Cardano is developing a smart contract platform which seeks to deliver more advanced features than any protocol previously developed. The development team consists of a large global collective of expert engineers and researchers. The protocol reportedly features a layered blockchain software stack that is flexible, scalable and is being developed with the most rigorous academic and commercial software standards in the industry. Cardano will use a democratic governance system that allows the project to evolve over time, and fund itself sustainably through a treasury system. Cardano also notes that it will combine users' need for privacy with regulation, so that Cardano's style of regulated computing will foster greater financial inclusion.\r\n\r\nCardano is supported by three organizations that are separate in both ownership and leadership. The Cardano Foundation is an independent, Swiss-based organization that oversees the development of the Cardano ecosystem, IOHK designs and builds Cardano and Emurgo is the for-profit arm that supports Cardano with commercial ventures. \r\nCardano's roadmap for development has been divided into five eras: Byron, Shelley, Goguen, Basho and Voltaire. While each separate era has its own set of functionalities that will be developed and supported in multiple code releases in a sequential order, the development of each era is parallel and simultaneous across the different systems.\r\nCardano also has its own block explorer, which allows users to check the history of ADA transactions that are publicly recorded on the blockchain.\r\n \r\n### How Do You Mine or Stake Cardano?\r\nCardano does not run on a proof-of-work blockchain like Bitcoin. Instead, Cardano has a proof-of-stake algorithm known as Ouroboros, which works in a specific way as compared to most proof-of-stake algorithms. Ouroboros divides up time slots called \"epochs,\" which can be compared to working a shift. Each epoch is led by one elected slot leader who is responsible for creating and confirming blocks in the Cardano blockchain. If one slot leader does not create a transaction block in their epoch, the next \"shift\" leader will try, with a minimum of 50 percent or more of the blocks produced within one epoch. The transactions in the blocks created by slot leaders are then approved by input endorsers, who are elected based on stakes. There can be more than one input endorser in each epoch.\r\n\r\nThe Ouroboro rewards system has incentives for availability and transaction verification, as opposed to using large amounts of power to mine coins like in proof-of-work. The rewards given for participating in the Cardano blockchain are split between three stakeholders: input endorsers, multiparty computation stakeholders, and slot leaders.\r\nCardano staking is a feature of the Shelley era of the roadmap. The Shelley Incentivized Testnet, live in May 2020, allows ADA holders to earn rewards by either delegating their stakes or running a stake pool.\r\n \r\n### How Can You Buy Cardano (ADA)?\r\nYou can buy ADA at any crypto exchange that supports the digital currency.

ADA can be stored on an exchange, or in a wallet.","links":{"website":["https://www.cardano.org"],"technical_doc":["https://www.cardano.org/en/academic-papers/"],"twitter":["https://twitter.com/cardano"],"reddit":["https://reddit.com/r/cardano"],"message_board":["https://medium.com/feed/cardanorss","https://forum.cardano.org/"],"announcement":["https://cardanodocs.com/cardano/monetary-policy/"],"chat":["https://t.me/CardanoAnnouncements"],"explorer":["https://cardanoexplorer.com/","https://seiza.com/home","https://adascan.net/","https://blockchair.com/cardano ","https://ada.tokenview.com/en"],"source_code":["https://cardanoupdates.com/"]}},{"id":1765,"coin":"EOS","name":"EOS","slug":"eos","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/1765.png","description":"### What Is EOS?\r\n \r\nEOSIO blockchain is a decentralized system that is powered by its native cryptocurrency, EOS, and supports decentralized applications (DApps) on its platform. Its native EOS tokens are often used for business purposes and can be used as a \"stake\" for funding DApps in the EOS ecosystem. Introduced in May 2017 by block.one, EOS does not stand for anything specific, because its creators have never formally defined it. Dan Larimer, who foundedBitshares and Steem, is the CTO of block.one.\r\n \r\nEOS initially held a year-long initial coin offering (ICO) in 2017, with a total of 200 million (20% of the tokens) distributed during a five-day period, 700 million more (70%) distributed over the rest of the year and 100 million (10%) held in escrow for block.one.\r\n \r\nThe EOS protocol acts like Google's Play Store and Apple's App store, emulating most of the attributes of a real computer, including hardware (CPU(s) & GPU(s) for processing, local/RAM memory and hard-disk storage) with the computing resources distributed equally among EOS cryptocurrency holders. EOS also supports a web-toolkit used for interface development.\r\n \r\nIn essence, EOSIO operates as a smart contract platform and decentralized operating system intended for the deployment of industrial-scale DApps through a decentralized autonomous corporation model. The smart contract platform claims to eliminate transaction fees and also conduct millions of transactions per second. EOS (EOS) is software that introduces a blockchain architecture designed to enable vertical and horizontal scaling of decentralized applications. The EOS software provides accounts, authentication, databases, asynchronous communication and the scheduling of applications across multiple CPU cores and/or clusters.\r\n \r\n\r\n### How Do You Mine EOS?\r\n \r\nEOS cannot be mined like proof-of-work cryptocurrencies because it uses a delegated proof-of-stake system; instead, block producers create the blocks and are rewarded for each block by the creation of new EOS tokens. Block producers are disincentivized from giving themselves higher rewards by a limiting mechanism that prevents total annual token supply from increasing more than 5%. EOS token holders also have the power to vote out block producers that they feel are not adhering to the ideals of EOS.\r\n \r\n\r\n### How Do You Buy EOS?\r\n \r\nYou can buy EOS on any cryptocurrency exchange that supports the token.

It was originally issued as an ERC-20 token running on the Ethereum network, with a total supply capped at 200 million coins, and 100 million BNBs offered in the ICO. However, the ERC-20 BNB coins were swapped with BEP2 BNB on a 1:1 ratio in April 2019 with the launch of the Binance Chain mainnet, and are now no longer hosted on Ethereum.\r\n \r\nBNB can be used as a payment method, a utility token to pay for fees on the Binance exchange and for participation in token sales on the Binance launchpad. BNB also powers the Binance DEX (decentralized exchange).\r\n \r\n \r\n### Can You Mine BNB?\r\n \r\nYou cannot mine BNB as you would a proof-of-work cryptocurrency, since the Binance Blockchain uses the Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus mechanism. Instead, there are validators that earn from securing the network by validating blocks.\r\n \r\n \r\n### What Is a BNB Burn?\r\n \r\nBefore BNB migrated to Binance Chain, Binance performed coin burns on the Ethereum network using a smart contract burn function. The amount of coins that Binance burns is based on the number of trades of the exchange over three months. Since the Binance Chain launch, BNB coin burns no longer take place on the Ethereum network and now use a specific command on Binance Chain, as opposed to a smart contract.\r\n \r\n \r\n### How Do You Buy BNB?\r\nYou can buy BNB on the Binance crypto exchange with a wire or bank transfer, a credit card or debit card, or any other exchanges that offer the cryptocurrency.

It was developed by Arthur Breitman, with support from his wife Kathleen Breitman, and launched an initial coin offering (ICO) in 2017 that raised $232 million US dollars. A year after the ICO, Tezos launched its beta network in July 2018.\r\n \r\nThe Tezos platform aims to combine a self-correcting protocol and on-chain governance to manage network modifications, and supports Turing complete smart contracts.\r\n \r\nTezos is also supported by the Tezos Foundation, which is a Swiss-based entity that promotes the Tezos protocol through grants and other capital vehicles.\r\n \r\n \r\n### How Does Tezos Work?\r\n\r\nTezos works by creating incentives for users to want to participate in the core development of the Tezos protocol. However, the blockchain also uses formal mathematical proofs to ensure that certain critical properties of the Tezos protocol are maintained, thus keeping the network decentralized.\r\n \r\n\r\n### Can You Mine Tezos?\r\n\r\nYou can't mine on the Tezos blockchain as you would a proof-of-work cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, as it is based instead on a proof-of-stake consensus (DPoS) mechanism rather than on a proof-of-work protocol. The Tezos protocol is powered by XTZ tokens, which are created through \"baking.\"\r\n \r\n\r\n### What Is Tezos Baking?\r\n\r\nInstead of mining, Tezos bakers (also known as delegates) earn rewards of Tezos tokens by staking, i.e. they put up deposits and are rewarded for signing and publishing blocks, and witnesses then validate the blocks. Dishonest bakers lose their XTZ deposits, which is an incentive to stay honest in the Tezos ecosystem. Tezos is implemented in the OCaml programming language, which is said to offer \"functional, imperative, and object-oriented styles.\"","links":{"website":["https://www.tezos.com/"],"technical_doc":["https://tezos.gitlab.io/"],"twitter":["https://twitter.com/tezos"],"reddit":["https://reddit.com/r/tezos"],"message_board":["https://www.tezos.ch/"],"announcement":[],"chat":["https://t.me/tezosplatform","https://riot.tzchat.org/"],"explorer":["https://tzstats.com/","https://tezblock.io/","https://tezos.id/","https://tzkt.io/","https://t.me/TezosNotifierBot"],"source_code":["https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos"]}},{"id":512,"coin":"XLM","name":"Stellar","slug":"stellar","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/512.png","description":"### What Is Stellar?\r\nThe Stellar network is an open-source, distributed and community-owned blockchain network used to facilitate cross-asset transfers of value. Stellar aims to facilitate these transfers at a fraction of a penny, while aiming to be an open financial system that gives people of all income levels access to low-cost financial services. The native digital currency of the Stellar network is known as Lumens (XLM). Every Stellar account is required to hold a small amount of Lumens to act as a barrier against spamming the Stellar payments system. Through the use of Lumens, a user can send any currency that they own to anyone else in a different currency.  Stellar also supports smart contracts.\r\n\r\nStellar was co-founded by former lawyer Joyce Kim and Jed McCaleb in 2014. Jed McCaleb is also the founder of the now-defunct Mt. Gox exchange, and the co-founder of Ripple. In fact, both payment networks used the same protocol initially. Like Ripple, Stellar is also a payment technology that aims to connect financial institutions and drastically reduce the cost and time required for cross-border transfers, although while Ripple focuses on banks, Stellar focuses on banking the unbanked. One of Stellar's largest partnerships is with IBM — signed in October 2017 — to set up multiple currency corridors for ease of payment in the South Pacific.\r\n\r\nStellar is also supported by the Stellar Development Foundation, a non-profit that helps with the maintenance of Stellar's codebase, and supports Stellar communities, among other things.\r\n \r\n### How Do You Mine Stellar?\r\nUnlike proof-of-work cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Stellar can't be mined. When the Stellar network went live in 2014, 100 billion Lumens were created with a 1% annual inflation rate. However, in October 2019, a community vote ended the inflation mechanism, and the overall lumen supply was reduced in November 2019, leaving the total supply at around 50 billion Lumens with no more Lumens to be created. While around 20 billion Lumens are in the open market, the Stellar Development Foundation has the other 30 billion, which it uses to support the Stellar ecosystem, but those Lumens will also gradually enter the open market.\r\n \r\n### How Do You Buy Stellar Lumens?\r\nYou can buy XLM on any exchange that offers the digital currency in your geographic region.

The Tron Foundation's 2017 initial coin offering (ICO) created 100 billion TRX and raised a total of $70 million.\r\n\r\nThe TRON Protocol represents the architecture of an operating system based on blockchain technology which could enable developers to create smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps), freely publish, own and store data and other content. According to the TRON Foundation, the ecosystem surrounding this network specializes in offering massive scalability and consistent reliability capable of processing transactions at a high rate via high-throughput computing. \r\nTRON was initially created as a token based on Ethereum, but migrated to its own network in 2018. Holders of ERC20 TRX tokens traded them for the TRX digital currency on the TRON network, and the Ethereum-based tokens were then destroyed. \r\n\r\nTRON founder Justin Sun is known for being active on social media. He is also the CEO of BitTorrent, and acquired Steem in 2020.\r\n\r\n### How Do You Mine TRON?\r\nTRON is based on a delegated proof-of-stake system, unliked Bitcoin's proof-of-work, where a rotating cast of 27 \"super representatives” validate the transaction on the blockchain. They are chosen every six hours, blocks are created on the blockchain every three seconds and super representatives receive 32 TRX as a block reward. You can also participate in the TRON blockchain by running a witness node (proposing blocks and voting on protocol decisions), a full node (broadcast transactions and blocks) or a Solidity node (syncs blocks from full nodes, provides APIs).\r\n\r\nUsers participate in staking on the TRON network by using \"Tron Power,\" a network resource equal to the amount of TRX that is being staked. \r\n \r\n### How Do You Buy TRON?\r\nYou can buy TRX through the TRON wallet or on any crypto exchange that supports TRX.

It is an open-source, privacy-oriented digital currency built on a blockchain that is designed to be opaque. With Monero, it is said you are in complete control of your funds and privacy, as no one else can see anyone else's balances or transactions. \r\n\r\nMonero works as a privacy-oriented cryptocurrency by using ring signatures and stealth addresses. A ring signature is an anonymous digital signature that does not reveal who signed the transaction. They are generated on the Monero platform through a combination of a sender's account keys and public keys on the blockchain. Stealth addresses are randomly-generated addresses that are created during each transaction for a one-time use, and they hide a transaction's destination address, as well as the receiver's identity. Ring confidential transactions (RingCT) also hides the amount of the transaction; this feature was added in January 2017 as a mandatory feature of all Monero network transactions. \r\n\r\nMonero is based on the CryptoNote protocol, and has a dynamic block size and fees, as opposed to Bitcoin.\r\n \r\n### How Do You Mine Monero?\r\nMonero mining can be done solo or by joining a mining pool. Unlike some proof-of-work cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, mining Monero does not require application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), even though it is based on a proof-of-work algorithm. Monero mining can be done on any CPU or GPU, on a Windows, Mac, Linux and Android, as the Monero mining algorithm specifically supports \"little\" nodes. \r\n\r\nA popular Monero miner, Coinhive, shut down in March 2019. The service had worked by generating a Monero mining script as an alternative to advertisements, as website visitors' CPU would be used to mine Monero, with the site getting a percentage of Monero mined in the place of ad revenue.\r\n \r\n### How Do You Use Monero?\r\nMonero is used as a cryptocurrency that offers a high level of anonymity and privacy.\r\n \r\n### How Do You Buy Monero?\r\nYou can buy Monero on any exchange that supports the currency and is available in your region.

In exchange for part of the block reward, masternodes provide a second layer of services to the network. They facilitate functions such as InstantSend, PrivateSend, and ChainLocks, which reportedly protect Dash against 51% mining attacks.\r\n\r\nDash governance system, or treasury, distributes 10% of the block rewards for the development of the project in a competitive and decentralized way. This has allowed the creation of many funded organizations, including Dash Core Group, Inc. (DCG), which supports continued development, integrations, and other activities of Dash.\r\n\r\nWithin the first 48 hours of Dash's launch, approximately 2.0 million coins were mined, which significantly exceeded the planned emission schedule. Dash was originally forked from Litecoin, and although Litecoin suffered a similar issue at its launch due to a bug in its difficulty adjustment algorithm, this was not widely understood at the time of Dash's launch. Excluding the first two Litecoin blocks (which were mined prior to release), coin emission during the first 24 hours was elevated resulting in the creation of 500,000 Litecoin in the first 24 hours. While it is well-documented that Dash inherited the bug from Litecoin, there has nonetheless been widespread speculation about whether the resulting fastmine was intentional to benefit early miners.\r\n\r\nMany individuals competed for block rewards at launch, similar to other projects launching at that time. In the subsequent years, Dash has been actively traded on exchanges through several market cycles, which today makes it one of the most well-distributed cryptocurrencies, according to [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/introducing-six-new-cryptocurrencies-in-bigquery-public-datasets-and-how-to-analyze-them).","links":{"website":["https://www.dash.org/","https://newsroom.dash.org/"],"technical_doc":["https://docs.dash.org/"],"twitter":["https://twitter.com/Dashpay"],"reddit":["https://reddit.com/r/dashpay"],"message_board":["https://www.dash.org/forum/"],"announcement":["https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=421615.0"],"chat":["https://t.me/dash_chat","https://discord.com/invite/PXbUxJB"],"explorer":["https://explorer.dash.org","https://insight.dash.org/insight/","https://chainz.cryptoid.info/dash/","https://dash.tokenview.com/en","https://blockchair.com/dash"],"source_code":["https://github.com/dashpay/dash"]}},{"id":1321,"coin":"ETC","name":"Ethereum Classic","slug":"ethereum-classic","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/1321.png","description":"Ethereum Classic is a decentralized blockchain platform that lets anyone build and use decentralized applications that run on blockchain technology.

Each synthetic asset (or Synth) is an ERC20 token which tracks the price of an external asset; for example, each sUSD token tracks the price of the US dollar (and unlike the other synthetic assets, is fixed at 1). A wide variety of Synths exists within Synthetix, including fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies, commodities, and inverse indexes. In principle, the system can support any asset with a clear price and provides on-chain exposure to an unlimited range of real-world assets. The protocol will enable a variety of trading features including binary options, futures, and more. \r\n\r\n###How does Synthetix work?\r\n\r\nSynthetix is otherwise composed of a smart contract infrastructure and a set of incentives that maintains Synth prices. It is underpinned by the value of the Synthetix Network Token (SNX). SNX acts as collateral; staking a proportional value of SNX is required to mint Synths. Stakers are rewarded for supporting the system with a pro-rata share of the fees generated by activity in the system. The value of SNX is thus directly connected with the usage of the network it collateralizes.\r\n\r\nThis mechanism allows Synthetix to support instantaneous, near-frictionless conversion between different flavors of Synths without the liquidity and slippage issues experienced by other decentralized exchanges. The resulting network of tokens supports an extensive set of use cases including trading, loans, payments, remittance, eCommerce, and more. \r\n\r\nSynthetix was launched in late 2017, originally under the name of Havven (HAV).","links":{"website":["https://www.synthetix.io/"],"technical_doc":["https://docs.synthetix.io/"],"twitter":["https://twitter.com/synthetix_io"],"reddit":["https://reddit.com/r/synthetix_io"],"message_board":["https://research.synthetix.io/"],"announcement":[],"chat":["https://discord.gg/AEdUHzt"],"explorer":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xc011a73ee8576fb46f5e1c5751ca3b9fe0af2a6f","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xc011a73ee8576fb46f5e1c5751ca3b9fe0af2a6f","https://blockchair.com/ethereum/erc-20/token/0xc011a73ee8576fb46f5e1c5751ca3b9fe0af2a6f","https://eth.tokenview.com/en/token/0xc011a73ee8576fb46f5e1c5751ca3b9fe0af2a6f"],"source_code":[]}},{"id":873,"coin":"XEM","name":"NEM","slug":"nem","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/873.png","description":"NEM (XEM), which stands for New Economy Movement, is a dual-layer blockchain that is written in Java and launched in 2015.

Unlike first-generation consensus mechanisms, Algorand's technology finalizes blocks in seconds and provides immediate transaction finality while preventing forks. Algorand does also not reward validators with newly minted tokens.\r\n\r\nWith a primary focus on developers and their needs, Algorand's node repository has been open-sourced and is publicly available. Algorand provides a robust set of developer tools, DApp analytics through a partnership with Flipside Crypto, and has a number of partners building on their blockchain, including OTOY, Syncsort, TOP Networks, Asset Block and more.\r\n\r\n- Maximum Supply (# or Uncapped): 10,000,000,000        \r\n- Genesis Block / Distribution Date: June 11, 2019        \r\n- Consensus Mechanism (Precise): Permissionless, Pure Proof of Stake         \r\n- Emission Type (Precise): Fixed supply with Pre-minted rewards        \r\n- Block Time (Seconds): Sub 5 seconds         \r\n\r\n###How does Algorand work?\r\n\r\nThe Algorand blockchain network has its own official native cryptocurrency, called the Algo, to drive the borderless economy and the system of incentives. The Foundation holds Algos to contribute to the stability of the Algorand blockchain, to incentivize network participation, and to support the Algorand community, ecosystem building, and research. The Algos enter the ecosystem via various channels including development and research grants, participation rewards, and sales. All such activities are disclosed with full transparency to the Algorand community.\r\n\r\nAlgorand Technology: Algorand utilizes a Pure Proof of Stake, where validators are not rewarded nor are they at risk of being slashed. It becomes impossible for the minority to cheat and irrational for the majority to cheat the system as it would devalue their holdings. There is also no locking of tokens so a user has their tokens available at all time. Blocks are created in two phases where a single token is selected randomly and its owner proposes the next block. Subsequently, 1000 random tokens are selected with their owners then approving the block proposed by the first user. \r\n\r\nThese phases are ensured by the core protocol called Binary Byzantine Agreement, or Byzantine Agreement ★ (‘Star’), encompassing the following advancements:\r\n\r\n- Cryptographic sortition (self-selection) To prevent an adversary from targeting committee members, BA★ uses verifiable random functions (VRFs) to randomly select committee members in a private and non-interactive way. \r\n- Participant replaceability. BA★ mitigates adversary targeting a committee member by requiring committee members to speak just once, thus becoming irrelevant to BA★. \r\n\r\nExperimental results running on 1,000 Amazon EC2 VMs demonstrate that Algorand can:\r\n\r\n- Confirm a 1 MByte block of transactions in ~22 seconds with 50,000 users\r\n- Latency remains nearly constant when scaling to half a million users\r\n- Achieve 125X the transaction throughput of Bitcoin\r\n- Achieve acceptable latency even in the presence of actively malicious users. \r\n\r\nA test network for the protocol was launched in July 2018, and the first open-source code was released on Github in October 2018. As such, Algorand encourages anyone to audit its version of the VRF, forked, and extended from the libsodium cryptographic library.","links":{"website":["http://algorand.foundation","https://www.algorand.com/"],"technical_doc":["https://www.algorand.com/resources/white-papers"],"twitter":["https://twitter.com/AlgoFoundation"],"reddit":["https://reddit.com/r/AlgorandOfficial"],"message_board":["https://medium.com/algorand-foundation","https://forum.algorand.org/"],"announcement":["https://algorand.foundation/algorand-foundation-marks-new-chapter-in-global-economics-with-inaugural-auction"],"chat":["https://t.me/AlgorandFoundation","https://discord.gg/QBYp7Y2"],"explorer":["https://algoexplorer.io/"],"source_code":["https://github.com/algorand"]}},{"id":109,"coin":"DGB","name":"DigiByte","slug":"digibyte","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/109.png","description":"### What Is DigiByte?\r\nDigiByte is an open-source blockchain, created in 2013 and released in early 2014 by DigiByte founder Jared Tate. Its network is based on three layers: smart contracts, decentralized applications (DApps) and customizable tokens. The middle layer, the public ledger, is where DigiByte digital assets exist in the network, while the third and bottom later hosts the decentralized nodes, the client software and their communication. A unique factor of DigiByte is its five mining algorithms — Sha256, Scrypt, Skein, Qubit and Odocrypt — whose advanced difficulty adjustment aims to keep the blockchain secure and protect it from malicious attacks. DigiByte has its own block explorer, DigiExplorer.\r\nDigiByte was the first major altcoin to activate Segwit in April 2017. \r\n\r\nIn May 2019, DigiByte launched DigiAssets, which is a scalable second-layer solution on top of the DigiByte blockchain that offers the decentralized issuance of assets, smart contracts, digital identity and other features. \r\n \r\n### Where Can You Mine DigiByte?\r\nDigiByte is only created through mining, as no tokens were created at its launch. It has a limit of 21 billion coins, which will all be mined by 2035. You can mine DigiByte solo or in a pool, using one of its five mining algorithms.\r\n \r\n### What Is DigiByte Used For?\r\nDigiByte can be used as a payment method, like a fiat currency, or a store of value.

The open-source digital currency was created by Billy Markus from Portland, Oregon and Jackson Palmer from Sydney, Australia, and was forked from Litecoin in December 2013. Dogecoin's creators envisaged it as a fun, light-hearted cryptocurrency that would have greater appeal beyond the core Bitcoin audience, since it was based on a dog meme. Tesla CEO Elon Musk posted several tweets on social media that Dogecoin is his favorite coin.\r\n \r\n### How Do You Mine Dogecoin?\r\nDogecoin differs from Bitcoin's proof-of-work protocol in several ways, one of which is by using Scrypt technology. The altcoin has also a block time of 1 minute, and the total supply is uncapped, which means that there is no limit to the number of Dogecoin that can be mined.\r\nYou can mine Dogecoin either solo, or by joining a mining pool. A Doge miner can mine the digital currency on Windows, Mac or Linux, and with a GPU. As of 2014, you can also mine Litecoin in the same process of mining Dogecoin, as the processes were merged.\r\n \r\n### What Can Dogecoin Be Used For?\r\nDogecoin has been used primarily as a tipping system on Reddit and Twitter to reward the creation or sharing of quality content. You can get tipped Dogecoin by participating in a community that uses the digital currency, or you can get your Dogecoin from a Dogecoin faucet. A Dogecoin faucet is a website that will give you a small amount of Dogecoin for free as an introduction to the currency, so that you can begin interacting in Dogecoin communities.\r\n \r\n### How Can You Buy Dogecoin?\r\nYou can buy or sell Dogecoin at any exchange that offers the digital currency, store it on an exchange or in a Dogecoin wallet, and tip Dogecoin in any communities that accept Dogecoin.

How the protocol processes transactions is centralized, but its Plasma-based design aims to decentralize network security. It also relies on Ethereum at its final arbitration layer. Most blockchain ecosystems are limited by low throughput, high and unpredictable transaction fees, and poor user experience. The project's team believes these are barriers that need to be overcome before businesses and developers will adopt blockchain for real-world applications, leading them to develop the OMG Network.\r\n\r\nThe core security proposition of Plasma revolves around honest users being able to exit the child chain (in other words, withdraw funds to the root chain) at any time. To exit the child chain, a user submits an exit transaction – along with an exit bond – to the root chain. The exit is subject to a \"challenge period,\" during which any user can prove, if applicable, that the exit is invalid. If successfully shown to be invalid, the exit is not processed, and the challenger is awarded the exit bond. This exit game is solely dependent on the root chain.\r\n\r\nAs the child chain relies on the root chain to be its ultimate arbiter, it must periodically commit a hashed version of its state changes to the root chain by way of a smart contract. As opposed to submitting individual transaction data onto the root chain, the child chain bundles transactions into a Merkle tree and submits the root hash. Beyond these core elements, there is no prescribed configuration for a Plasma chain. They can take on different consensus protocols, block validation mechanisms, or fraud proofs. The design is adaptable to the use case. OMG Network is based on the Plasma MoreVP design, an extension of Minimum Viable Plasma optimized for the settlement of payments and value exchange between users and exchanges.\r\n\r\nThe original OMG Network team (under the OmiseGO name) co-authored the original Plasma white paper with Joseph Poon and was also the first project to perform an airdrop, a way to more widely share ownership of our token with the existing Ethereum community.","links":{"website":["https://omg.network/","https://omisego.co/"],"technical_doc":["https://docs.omg.network/"],"twitter":["https://twitter.com/omgnetworkhq"],"reddit":["https://reddit.com/r/omise_go"],"message_board":[],"announcement":[],"chat":["https://t.me/omgnetwork"],"explorer":["https://omg.eco/blockexplorer","https://etherscan.io/token/OmiseGo","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xd26114cd6EE289AccF82350c8d8487fedB8A0C07","https://blockchair.com/ethereum/erc-20/token/0xd26114cd6ee289accf82350c8d8487fedb8a0c07","https://omisego.to/quest"],"source_code":["https://github.com/omgnetwork"]}},{"id":4642,"coin":"HBAR","name":"Hedera Hashgraph","slug":"hedera-hashgraph","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/4642.png","description":"Hedera describes itself as a decentralized public network where developers can build secure, fair applications with near real-time consensus.

The upshot of this is the ability to reach consensus more quickly, which would increase the number of transactions in a given period.

The company is focused on bringing cryptocurrency to ordinary users by making it more user-friendly and reducing user error.  \r\n\r\nThe Divi team launched its blockchain on 27 September 2018. The team is reportedly known for inventing the multi-tier masternode concept, and claims to be the only masternode that can be set up from the wallet with a single click using its \"MOCCI\" system.  Divi also has weekly lottery blocks that pay 11 of its stakers. Divi aims to create its own user-friendly \"Chain Lightning\" network that they believe will be more usable than Bitcoin's version.  It will have atomic swaps, an advanced governance system, and a multi-coin wallet that is designed to make Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies user-friendly too. \r\n\r\nThe Divi Project won third place in the 2018 \"Token Tank\" contest at World Crypto Con in Las Vegas, and also was rated the #3 best Masternode, behind only Dash and PIVX, by Omni Analytics. The Divi team includes four different advisers who speak frequently on the national circuit.  This includes former Yahoo Chief Solutions Officer Tim Sanders, futurist Ramez Naam, former Coin Telegraph CEO Toni Lane Casserly, Doug Scott, former President of Ogilvy Entertainment, and top crypto influencers Joel Comm and Travis Wright from the Bad Crypto Podcast.

For the initial phase, Matic has launched its hybrid PoS+Plasma sidechain on top of Ethereum. According to the team, Matic is one of the fastest-growing DApp platforms in the space.\r\n\r\nMatic believes the answer to enabling widespread adoption of blockchain technology lies with second-layer solutions focused on scalability. To this end, Matic Network provides massive scaling capabilities whilst leveraging the security and decentralization of the mainchain.\r\n\r\nAs a general-purpose platform, Matic is capable of housing a limitless array of DApp types on their infrastructure. So far, Matic has attracted more than 50 DApps to its PoS-secured Ethereum sidechain. DApps on Matic encompass a variety of niches ranging from gaming to DeFi, with notable projects including VR metaverse projects Decentraland, Somnium Space, The Sandbox, and Whitelabel betting platform BetProtocol.\r\n\r\nEssentially, Matic aims to provide the infrastructure to overcome the traditional performance bottlenecks of the blockchain ecosystem, to allow all types of DApps to be able to handle large volumes of users.\r\n\r\n###Background and Vision\r\n\r\nThe Matic team has been contributing to the Ethereum ecosystem long before the formation of Matic Network and their IEO on Binance in April 2019. This includes working on implementations of Plasma MVP, the WalletConnect protocol (which allows users to access DApps in a secure and user-friendly way), and the widely-used Dagger event notification engine.\r\n\r\nMatic is passionate about decentralization and better blockchain-based products and is working towards their core goal of facilitating mass adoption of blockchain. They believe that the current decentralized ecosystem lacks usability and convenience - decentralized transactions are slow, expensive, and complex - and therefore the blockchain environment as it stands today is unable to facilitate mainstream-level DApps. Solving this problem is Matic’s mission.\r\n\r\nMatic aims to overcome these hurdles by leveraging a combination of blockchain scaling, developer platform and tools, and a keen focus on user experience. Their Layer 2 solution will enable countless DApps around the world to process TPS rates as high as 65,000 per second, per Matic sidechain. By providing this high-performance infrastructure, Matic aims to revolutionize the way a broad range of applications is created, from decentralized finance to gaming, thus shaping the user experience of end-users around the world.\r\n\r\n###How Does Staking Work on Matic Network?\r\n\r\nAs a Layer 2 solution utilizing a network of Proof-of-Stake validators for asset security, staking is an integral part of the Matic ecosystem. Essentially, validators will stake their MATIC tokens as collateral to become part of the network’s PoS consensus mechanism and will receive MATIC tokens in return.\r\nMATIC holders who wish to stake but do not wish to be a validator, or are not able to be a validator, can delegate their tokens to a validator of their choice and still take part in their staking process and earn staking rewards. \r\n\r\n###About MATIC Token\r\n \r\nMATIC is the utility token used on the Matic Network blockchain. It has a range of purposes, including paying network transaction fees and participating in Matic Network’s Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. Due to demand, MATIC has also been integrated into several external platforms as a payment method.\r\n\r\nYou can purchase MATIC on any exchange which supports the digital currency.

Launched in 2017 with a $40 million ICO, its platform aims to provide a mobile-first payment solution for the world’s unbanked population, which to this day accounts for more than 1 billion people worldwide. \r\n\r\nWhilst the Electroneum app enables anyone to hold and transfer value in ETN instantly across the world at very little cost (a fraction of a US cent), it’s their complementary platforms that have reportedly led the company to acquire 4+ million users worldwide.\r\n\r\nThousands of users are reportedly benefitting from ETN by selling their services on AnyTask.com – a freelance marketplace launched by Electroneum in 2020. The platform allows freelancers to sell their services for free and without incurring costs on their earnings, which are delivered instantly in ETN following the approval of their work. \r\n\r\nETNDonate.com is another solution launched by Electroneum in 2020, which aims to make it easier for charities to promote themselves for free. They receive international donations in ETN at zero cost and are able to move those donations anywhere in the world quickly, ensuring they go to the right place without incurring cross border transfer fees.\r\n\r\nFrom a regulatory standpoint, Electroneum voluntarily introduced KYC and AML compliance procedures in 2018 ahead of the European 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive, ensuring all new users are onboarded accordingly and that we operate within guidelines set out by the 5th EU AML directive (and as subsequently enshrined in the laws of England & Wales).\r\n\r\n### What Can Electroneum (ETN) be Used For?\r\n\r\nUsers can spend their ETN from within the Electroneum app on a growing number of everyday essentials, including electricity and mobile airtime and data. These services have already been used thousands of times and Electroneum has pledged to continue adding more services just like this. Businesses can also begin accepting ETN via the app, or via the growing list of API integrations. For a full list of where you can spend ETN, visit the official Electroneum store directory - ETNEverywhere.com.\r\n\r\n### Can You Mine Electroneum (ETN)?\r\n\r\nNo, the Electroneum blockchain is a permissioned network. In 2019, Electroneum responded to corporate demand by moving to an in-house designed protocol called Proof of Responsibility (PoR). Compared with Proof of Work (PoW), this brought with it a host of benefits, including greater security, a massive reduction in energy consumption, and a redirection of ETN block rewards to educational initiatives.\r\n\r\n### How Does Electroneum (ETN) Work?\r\n\r\nElectroneum’s blockchain consists of a monitoring layer that evaluates the network for security breach attempts. This layer provides Electroneum with a minimal, but sufficient level of interference to secure the network against a double-spend or 51% attack. If hackers were to breach the security of a permissioned validator, the moderating layer would immediately detect the breach and rescind the rights of that miner.\r\n\r\n### What is an Electroneum (ETN) Halving?\r\n\r\nIn July 2020, Electroneum pledged to keep ETN’s inflation rate to less than 2%. With that in mind, they implemented a series of halving events, the first of which took place in July 2020 and will continue every four years until 2032. After the 2032 halving, no more block reward reductions are planned until the maximum supply of 21 billion ETN is reached. Once this point is reached, the block reward gets reduced from 50 ETN to 25 ETN per block. \r\n\r\n### How Do You Buy Electroneum (ETN)?\r\n\r\nYou can buy ETN on any exchange that offers the token. For the full list of exchanges and trading pairs, please click on the market pairs tab above or visit Electroneum.com. Remember to do your own research before choosing an exchange.\r\n\r\n### How Do You Store Electroneum (ETN)?\r\n\r\nWhilst you can store ETN on an exchange, the team always recommends using a wallet. You can store ETN within the Electroneum app, or for greater security, you can store your ETN on a paper wallet, which is downloadable at Electroneum.com. Ledger support is also coming in 2020 for ETN, so be sure to sign up for our updates at the Electroneum Newsroom.","links":{"website":["http://electroneum.com/"],"technical_doc":[],"twitter":["https://twitter.com/electroneum"],"reddit":["https://reddit.com/r/Electroneum"],"message_board":["https://electroneum.com/blog/","https://community.electroneum.com/"],"announcement":["https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2353282.0"],"chat":["https://t.me/joinchat/DxoSakHOdk5mqsE-LelfVg"],"explorer":["https://blockexplorer.electroneum.com/"],"source_code":["https://github.com/electroneum"]}},{"id":2300,"coin":"WAXP","name":"WAX","slug":"wax","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/2300.png","description":"WAX is a purpose-built blockchain and protocol token designed to make e-commerce transactions faster, easier, and safer for all participants.

Reducing the industries need for Smart Contracts by using custom transactions, logic, and multiple programming languages. ARK was founded in mid-2016, running an ICO later that year which raised $800k. The team claims that sound financial planning has allowed ARK to become a well-funded entity since its inception. On March 21, 2017, the ARK Public Network went live, hosting the native ARK crypto asset. The ARK business entity, ARK ECOSYSTEM SCIC, was formed shortly thereafter. The business entity is commonly referred to as 'ARK.io' which is part of the team's branding and website.\r\n\r\nThe ARK Ecosystem consists of an open-source blockchain technology stack authored in TypeScript programming language. \r\n\r\n- ARK’s public network acts as a live implementation of ARK technology\r\n- Node operators act as delegates on the network- \r\n- Standalone blockchains run on ARK technology with independent node operators\r\n- A business entity that develops products powered by ARK and assists in maintaining the code base\r\n- An enterprise division driving adoption\r\n- A community of users, developers and service providers.\r\n\r\nThe ARK Public Network supports special transaction types such as multipayment, multisignature, various registration transactions, and IPFS hash transactions. ARK’s Deployer product allows customizable interoperable blockchain creation using a graphical user interface. This plug and play creation method allows developers to utilize ARK’s consensus model, technology stack, product line, and custom transactions.\r\n\r\n###What Is ARK Trying To Solve?\r\n\r\nARK aims to solve the difficulty of working with blockchain technology and developing solutions that satisfy various use cases. The ARK Core Framework is designed to give developers easier access to blockchain technology. This framework consists of the ARK Core, which acts as the backbone of an ARK-based network, handling peer-to-peer operations, ledger database management, API access, custom business logic, and more. Within the ARK Core Framework is the Generic Transaction Interface (GTI), which enables developers to create custom transaction types that run on a customized blockchain and fulfill the developer's desired use case. The concept is similar to building a decentralized application in Solidity. However, there is no complex new language to learn as the GTI functions in TypeScript. Lastly, the decentralized ARK-based application and any related crypto assets would run on a sovereign interoperable blockchain to address scaling concerns. \r\n\r\n###How Do You Mine Or Stake ARK?\r\n\r\nYou cannot mine ARK via PoW. ARK is forged by elected delegates that run the network. ARK runs on a custom-designed Delegated Proof-of-Stake blockchain with 51 forging delegate slots and eight-second block times. Each forged block creates 2 ARK which is sent to the validating/forging delegate for its work. Delegates are elected by ARK token holders. The token holders voting power is locked at 1 ARK = 1 Vote, as users cannot vote for more than one delegate with a given wallet address. This addresses concerns with centralization and power groups that have plagued DPoS in the past. Potential forging delegates can run instances of the ARK Core and campaign for forging status by gathering vote weight from token holders. Users who wish to place their delegate into one of the top 51 slots execute a special vote transaction using the ARK Desktop or ARK Mobile wallets, assigning vote weight to the delegate. ARK used in voting is not locked and can freely exit and enter the voting wallet address at any time. The staking rewards system is handled by the delegates themselves and each delegate's reward system is completely unique to each. The ARK team does not run the ARK public network.\r\n\r\n###Where Can You Buy ARK?\r\n\r\nYou can buy ARK at any crypto exchange that supports the digital currency. For the latest list of exchanges and trading pairs for this cryptocurrency, you can check out the full list on the ARK website or click on the market pairs tab on CoinMarketCap. There are also downloadable exchange plugins for the ARK Desktop Wallet. ARK can be stored on an exchange, in the ARK wallets, multi-asset crypto wallets, crypto debit card wallets, or ledger hardware wallets.","links":{"website":["http://ark.io/"],"technical_doc":["https://ark.io/Whitepaper.pdf"],"twitter":["https://twitter.com/ArkEcosystem"],"reddit":["https://reddit.com/r/ArkEcosystem"],"message_board":["https://blog.ark.io/"],"announcement":["https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1649695.0"],"chat":["https://arkecosystem.slack.com/","https://discordapp.com/invite/VNRfxwQ"],"explorer":["https://explorer.ark.io/"],"source_code":["https://github.com/ArkEcosystem"]}},{"id":3701,"coin":"RIF","name":"RSK Infrastructure Framework","slug":"rsk-infrastructure-framework","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/3701.png","description":"RIF (Rootstock Infrastructure Framework) is a third layer on top of Bitcoin that provides a wide range of solutions based on blockchain technology such as payments, storage, and domaining (RNS).

The Origin Platform allows buyers and sellers to connect and transact on the blockchain. The project's goals are to reduce/remove unnecessary transaction fees charged by intermediaries, promote open and censorship-resistance commerce, and give early ecosystem participants stakes in the commerce network as it grows over time.\r\n\r\n###Products\r\n\r\nOrigin's main product offering is the Origin Platform that powers many different applications in the ecosystem. The project released the first version of the Platform to the Ethereum Mainnet in October of 2018 and has since upgraded its features several times since then. In addition to supporting third-parties, Origin has released several first-party applications on top of the Platform, including the Dshop e-commerce store creator (www.originprotocol.com/dshop), the Origin Marketplace DApp (www.shoporigin.com), and Origin Deals (www.origindeals.com).\r\n\r\n###Traction\r\n\r\nOrigin currently powers over a dozen partner e-commerce and marketplace applications on its Platform.\r\n\r\n###Underlying Technology\r\n\r\nThe Origin Platform consists of a series of smart contracts at the protocol layer, intermediary APIs that allow for in-house and third-party app creation, and the application/UX layer that end users interface with to buy/sell on the network. The components of the Platform are designed to be modular, and Origin strongly encourages other developers, e-commerce merchants, and marketplace operators to create their own applications for various business use cases. Origin is built on Ethereum and IPFS, and Origin Tokens (OGC) are ERC-20 tokens.\r\n\r\n###Team and Investors\r\n\r\nOrigin's founding team and early engineers include one of the original co-founders of PayPal, YouTube's first employee, and engineering managers from Dropbox and Google. The two co-founders, Matthew Liu and Josh Fraser have successfully built and sold previous companies together in the past.\r\n\r\nOrigin's lead investor is Pantera Capital. They are also backed by Foundation Capital, Blockchain.com Ventures, Hashed, PreAngel Fund, BlockTower Capital, FBG, Sora Ventures, and other venture/crypto funds as well as angel investors Steve Chen (co-founder of YouTube), Alexis Ohanian (co-founder of Reddit), Garry Tan (former Ycombinator partner), Gil Penchina, and Steve Jang (founding advisor and angel investor in Uber).","links":{"website":["https://www.originprotocol.com","https://www.shoporigin.com"],"technical_doc":["https://www.originprotocol.com/whitepaper"],"twitter":["https://twitter.com/originprotocol"],"reddit":["https://reddit.com/r/originprotocol"],"message_board":["https://medium.com/originprotocol/introducing-origin-6e7e3a1cd1c9","https://medium.com/originprotocol"],"announcement":[],"chat":["https://www.originprotocol.com/discord","https://t.me/originprotocol"],"explorer":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x8207c1ffc5b6804f6024322ccf34f29c3541ae26","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x8207c1ffc5b6804f6024322ccf34f29c3541ae26"],"source_code":["https://github.com/originprotocol"]}},{"id":541,"coin":"SYS","name":"Syscoin","slug":"syscoin","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/541.png","description":"Syscoin Platform provides trustless interoperability, token and asset microtransactions that are scalable, and bitcoin-core-compliant security.

Originally developed inside The Walt Disney Company in Seattle in 2014 by Joe Roets, and then open-sourced in 2016. The public/private hybrid blockchain platform also allows integration with external blockchains and legacy systems through Interchain™, integrating third party oracles, API's, IoT, supply chain, and other business data. Dragonchain proved its interoperability in 2016 and is currently using its Interchain™ to connect to Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Chain, and Ethereum Classic. Easily migrate from off-chain, to on-chain, while remaining GDPR capable. Developers can write their own smart contracts in any coding language, such as C++, Go, JavaScript, Java, Python, Ruby, Shell, C#, Hy, Rails, PHP and others allowing them to build (decentralized) blockchain applications on-premise or in multi-cloud environments. \r\n\r\n\r\nOn January 7, 2020, Dragonchain demonstrated over 250 million transactions over a 24-hour livestream event, averaging over 1500 transactions per second. Later that year Medek Health launched Covid SafePass with the City of Apopka, using Dragonchain blockchain solutions in line with the FDA guidance on Digital Health Policies and Public Health Solutions for COVID-19. Dragonchain also built several solutions in-house on top of the open source platform, including Dragon Factor (decentralized identity), Den (decentralized social media), Provably Fair Contest System (contests, casinos, lotteries, give-aways), Lyceum (Training courses & certificates on chain), and Eternal (archiving, legal proof, predictions). \r\n\r\n\r\nHow to ‘mine’?\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no mining involved. The community acts as a decentralized validation, diversity, and notary service. One of the patents granted to Dragonchain revolves around loyalty & rewards on blockchain. While the enterprise develops their applications on a private Level 1 Business node, the Dragonchain community and selected partners run their own Level 2 Validation, Level 3 Diversity, and Level 4 Notary nodes. Level 5 nodes are the public checkpoints to external blockchains such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Binance Chain. Level 5 nodes can be run and managed by Dragonchain, or the specific blockchain itself through a partner program, bringing interoperability to all blockchains. \r\n\r\n\r\nFor the Dragonchain community members who are running nodes, the amount of TIME each node runner applies to a certain level, determines their rewards.TIME is a loyalty score on top of the DRGN token. For each DRGN held in a non-exchange wallet, they receive 1 TIME loyalty score per day automatically. The more TIME someone applies to a L2, L3, or L4 node, the higher the reward granted when your node is selected through the matchmaking process. Community members securing Dragon Net’s 5 levels of trust can join pooled nodes, or run their own unmanaged nodes.","links":{"website":["https://dragonchain.com/"],"technical_doc":["https://dragonchain.com/assets/Dragonchain_Business_Summary.pdf"],"twitter":["https://twitter.com/dragonchaingang"],"reddit":["https://reddit.com/r/dragonchain"],"message_board":[],"announcement":["https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2096284.0"],"chat":["https://t.me/dragontalk"],"explorer":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x419c4db4b9e25d6db2ad9691ccb832c8d9fda05e","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x419c4db4b9e25d6db2ad9691ccb832c8d9fda05e"],"source_code":["https://github.com/dragonchain/dragonchain"]}},{"id":5350,"coin":"XPR","name":"Proton","slug":"proton","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/5350.png","description":"Launched in San Francisco, Proton (XPR) is a new public blockchain and smart contract platform designed for both consumer applications and peer-peer payments.

The HEX smart contract penalizes stakers for ending their stake early and rewards them for staking larger amounts of HEX for longer periods.\r\n\r\nHEX is distributed to Bitcoin holders by way of a snapshot of the Bitcoin UTXO set that occurred on 2 December 2019 at block height 606227. The distribution of HEX to Bitcoin holders is 10,000 HEX per 1 BTC. Bitcoin holders are able to claim HEX only during the first year of launch. During this period, HEX is also obtained in exchange for ETH through interacting with the HEX smart contract.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the first year of launch, all HEX coins that were not claimed by Bitcoin holders are distributed to the rest of the HEX users who have stakes that are active. The maximum possible annual inflation of HEX is designed to be 3.69% after the first year of launch.","links":{"website":["https://hex.com/","https://go.hex.win/"],"technical_doc":["https://hex.win/techspecs.html"],"twitter":["https://twitter.com/HEXcrypto"],"reddit":["https://reddit.com/r/HEXcrypto"],"message_board":[],"announcement":["https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4523610.0"],"chat":["https://t.me/HEXcrypto"],"explorer":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x2b591e99afe9f32eaa6214f7b7629768c40eeb39","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x2b591e99afe9f32eaa6214f7b7629768c40eeb39"],"source_code":["https://github.com/BitcoinHEX"]}},{"id":3085,"coin":"INO","name":"INO COIN","slug":"ino-coin","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/3085.png","description":"Launched on 10 Jan 2018 by a team based in Malta, Ino Coin was built with the sole mission of helping new businesses with funding raising. \r\n\r\nAfter investing in INO, users can reportedly receive smart services products from the projects they support.

The Sologenic ecosystem aims to make it effortless for crypto investors to exchange assets and invest in different conventional financial instruments. \r\n\r\nThe ecosystem aims to eliminate entry barriers for individual and institutional crypto investors. Sologenic allows them to trade non-blockchain asset classes, such as stocks, ETFs, and commodities, with one cryptocurrency SOLO. \r\n\r\n### Tokenize Assets with SOLO\r\n\r\nSOLO holders have access to a wide range of stocks from more than 30 global exchanges in North America, Europe, Asia, and Oceania. SOLO will enable people worldwide to buy and sell stock in their favorite companies without the need for traditional brokerages. \r\n\r\nSologenic generates stablecoins backed 1:1 with real-world assets. Each stablecoin represents the ownership of real-world assets. Once tokenized, the asset issued on the blockchain is denominated with the suffix Ƨ, for example, a tokenized asset of TSLA is represented as TSLAƨ.  \r\n\r\n### Trade Assets 24/7 on Sologenic's Decentralized Exchange\r\n\r\nUsers can trade these tokenized assets against SOLO or XRP on Sologenic’s Decentralized Exchange (DEX). The users hold their private keys of the wallets, providing them complete ownership and authority over their crypto assets. The XRP Ledger allows for swift transactions, quick settlements, and improved security of the user's cryptocurrencies.\r\n\r\n100% of the transaction fees are burned by being sent to the gateway’s issuing address (Blackhole). This means that Sologenic practices a deflationary mechanism to bring down the total supply of SOLO tokens.\r\n\r\n### Solo Cards\r\n\r\nSOLO holders are eligible to obtain a free SOLO Card to spend their cryptos or tokenized assets anywhere in the world. SOLO holders have various benefits with the SOLO Cards, such as monthly cashback, airport lounge access, discounts on select hotels and private events. \r\n\r\n### Solo Staking\r\n\r\nSOLO holders can voluntarily participate in the Liquidity Provider Reward Program (LPRP), and receive rewards of up to 20% annually. There are multiple time-based programs, with both weekly or monthly participation models. Some of these programs come with flexible withdrawal terms, whereas others come with a fixed time-based deposit model. There is a daily reward payout mechanism for flexible programs and a time-based payout for fixed-term reward programs.","links":{"website":["https://www.sologenic.com/"],"technical_doc":["https://www.sologenic.com/downloads/sologenic-whitepaper.pdf"],"twitter":["https://twitter.com/realSologenic"],"reddit":["https://reddit.com/r/Sologenic"],"message_board":[],"announcement":[],"chat":["https://t.me/SOLOGENICxGoSOLO"],"explorer":["https://bithomp.com/explorer/rsoLo2S1kiGeCcn6hCUXVrCpGMWLrRrLZz"],"source_code":["https://github.com/sologenic"]}},{"id":5336,"coin":"HMR","name":"Homeros","slug":"homeros","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/5336.png","description":"Homeros offers a platform intended for both game developers and gamers.

Bluzelle is powered by Cosmos and its BFT technology Tendermint, making it compatible with various blockchains. As developers continue to build Dapps, relying on centralized databases by AWS, Microsoft and others is a centralized point of failure. True freedom requires the full stack to be decentralized, not just one part. That’s where Bluzelle aims to provide a critical piece in the advancement Defi, supply chains, gaming, and other Web 3.0 sectors. \r\n\r\nStarting in March 2016, Bluzelle worked on blockchain applications for banks like HSBC, OCBC, MUFG, and insurance companies like AIA and MSIG. From those learnings, Bluzelle realized the need for a decentralized database as its enterprise projects were being stored on centralized systems. This caused major pains and in 2017 the team began architecting its solution. \r\n\r\nBluzelle is able to provide this solution by acting like the AirBnB of databases. Spare computer storage is sourced from the public, who in turn act as validators for the network, confirming the data is owned and modified by the rightful owner. For this, the storage provider earns a share of the revenue. For customers, Bluzelle can reportedly offer storage at an estimated half the cost of the others. \r\n\r\nBluzelleNet powers the entire ecosystem as a 10,000 TPS Proof-of-Stake network. Becoming a validator was designed to be an easy process with minimal technical knowledge. The vision is to have a network of tens of thousands of nodes working together to provide the most available and secure database in the world. Bluzelle wants every device to become a node, from computer hard drives to video game consoles to mobile phones. For those that do not want to become a validator, they are able to delegate their tasks to another validator, ensuring everyone can be part of the network and generate fees. \r\n\r\nMembers of the Bluzelle team have worked for Disney, Sony, Google, Lufthansa, Electronic Arts. They are recipients of the Technology Pioneer award by the World Economic Forum and named by Forrester as a top blockchain vendor in Asia. Its team is based in two locations, Singapore and Vancouver (Canada). Bluzelle is backed by industry funds like NGC, Hashed, KR1, and Kenetic.","links":{"website":["https://bluzelle.com/"],"technical_doc":["https://bluzelle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/bluzelle-whitepaper-english1-4.pdf"],"twitter":["https://twitter.com/bluzellehq"],"reddit":["https://reddit.com/r/Bluzelle"],"message_board":[],"announcement":[],"chat":["https://t.me/bluzelle"],"explorer":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x5732046a883704404f284ce41ffadd5b007fd668","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x5732046a883704404f284ce41ffadd5b007fd668"],"source_code":[]}},{"id":3721,"coin":"HPT","name":"Huobi Pool Token","slug":"huobi-pool-token","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/3721.png","description":"Huobi Pool Token (HPT) is a cryptocurrency token and operates on the Ethereum platform.

This increases the ability to perform business processes on-chain, leading to significant cost reduction.\r\n- Public. Users do not need the approval of a trusted authority to use the Dusk Network blockchain. Besides, only minimal processing power and modest IT resources to join. All users who possess the DUSK token can participate in the consensus.\r\n\r\n###How does it work?\r\n\r\nThrough the use of a transactional model called Phoenix, Dusk Network focuses on bringing privacy and anonymity to both transactions and smart-contracts. Additionally, tokens deployed on Dusk Network can build on top of Zedger, a hybrid privacy-preserving model based on Phoenix, specifically modeled for security tokens.\r\n\r\nThe ‘Segregated Byzantine Agreement’ (SBA) consensus mechanism secures the network. According to the team from Dusk Network, SBA is an improvement over the underlying Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism as it combines existing ideas like cryptographic sortition (lottery), stealth time-locked transactions (private stake amounts) and a reputation module to increase the chances of selecting honest nodes and further promote decentralization.\r\n\r\nDUSK tokens can be used as a utility token to initiate transactions and atomic swaps, or for the deployment of smart contracts. DUSK can also be staked to participate in consensus and serves as a means of exchanging DUSK-denominated value. In the future, the team intends to expand the use-cases of DUSK by adding it to an on-chain governance system.\r\n \r\nDusk Network was founded in 2018 and is based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.","links":{"website":["https://www.dusk.network"],"technical_doc":["https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/dusk-network/whitepaper/releases/download/v0.3/dusk-whitepaper.pdf"],"twitter":["https://twitter.com/DuskFoundation"],"reddit":["https://reddit.com/r/DuskNetwork"],"message_board":["https://medium.com/dusk-network"],"announcement":["https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4656203.0"],"chat":["https://t.me/DuskNetwork"],"explorer":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x940a2db1b7008b6c776d4faaca729d6d4a4aa551","https://explorer.binance.org/asset/DUSK-45E"],"source_code":["https://github.com/dusk-network"]}},{"id":4281,"coin":"BHT","name":"BHEX Token","slug":"bhex-token","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/4281.png","description":"BHT is the token issued by the BHEX trading platform ecosystem.","links":{"website":["https://www.hbtc.com/"],"technical_doc":["https://www.bhex.com/BHex_1.0_en.pdf"],"twitter":["https://twitter.com/BHEXOfficial"],"reddit":[],"message_board":[],"announcement":[],"chat":["https://t.me/BHEX_EN","https://t.me/BHEX_CHN"],"explorer":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xfc29b6e626b67776675fff55d5bc0452d042f434","https://ethplorer.io/token/0xfc29b6e626b67776675fff55d5bc0452d042f434"],"source_code":["https://github.com/bhexopen"]}},{"id":2496,"coin":"POLY","name":"Polymath","slug":"polymath-network","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/2496.png","description":"Polymath (POLY) is creating a global platform for issuing and investing in securities tokens.

It was initially launched as an ERC20 token on the Ethereum blockchain, and was designed to be the main currency in the Kik messenger ecosystem. Kik had initially launched a rewards points system, not a cryptocurrency, called Kik Points that ended in 2017. Kin is short for Kinship, since its aim was to strengthen ties within the Kik community. Kik raised around $100 million dollars in the Kin initial coin offering (ICO) in September 2017. In September 2019, Kik said that it would be shutting down its messaging app in order to fight an ongoing lawsuit with the United States Security and Exchange Commission over whether the Kin ICO sold unregistered securities. In October 2019, MediaLab bought Kik messenger, with the goal of preserving Kin.\r\n \r\n### How Does Kin Work?\r\nKin tokens enter circulation via an incentive model referred to as the Kin Rewards Engine, or \"KRE,\" which rewards the developers that create compelling user experiences with Kin based on their engagement. This offers a software monetization model that incentivizes the adoption of new use cases and creation of value for a cryptocurrency, as well as encouraging the exchange of value between users, as opposed to harvesting user data and attention at no benefit to users themselves. This new alternative re-aligns users and developers around a shared digital economy in which the content creators and developers that generate value are the focus, not big-data monopolies.\r\nThe Kin blockchain operates autonomously via a federated consensus model, currently composed of 11+ globally distributed validator nodes, in order to maintain fault tolerance while also allowing for little-to-no fees and fast confirmation speeds. The identities of the node operators are currently private in order to maintain operational security, but these are reportedly independent, reputable digital service providers, with a history of reliable availability and maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe distribution and algorithmic logic of the Kin Rewards Engine is overseen by the Kin Foundation, a non-profit organization based out of Ontario, Canada. Undistributed Kin is held in an institutional-grade treasury that is controlled via a series of vesting periods, inflation guidelines and fiduciary custody controls that ensure the safe transfer and proper use of funds. Anti-spam and anti-fraud assurances are also provided as a service until such time that the distribution of Kin can be fully automated with those additional safeguards in place. No more than 10 trillion Kin will ever exist in the Kin ecosystem by the end of the distribution period, the large supply meant to allow mass adoption by users around the world while still transacting in whole-number denominations, as opposed to decimal places.\r\n \r\n### Where Can You Buy Kin?\r\nYou can buy Kin at any cryptocurrency exchange that offers the digital currency. Remember to do your own research before choosing an exchange.

The main features of the QuarkChain Network are:\r\n\r\n- Flexibility: QuarkChain is a public chain that can support multiple consensuses, multiple transaction models ( including virtual machines VMs), ledger, and token economics in one network. It can reportedly adapt to blockchain innovations by customizing consensus, transaction model (including VM), ledger, and token economics in each shard so that to satisfy different requirements of different industries/enterprises/DApps. The network supports two consensus algorithms, PoW and PoSW ( a combination of PoS+ PoW). More consensus algorithms (DPoS, PoS and etc) will be added into different shards in the future. It is EVM-compatible - every DApp deployed on Ethereum can be deployed in QuarkChain. The team plans to add more virtual machines (e.g. EOS VM) in different shards so that developers have more choices.\r\n- Scalability: QuarkChain aims to deliver 100,000+ on-chain TPS. Currently, 55000+ peak TPS has already been achieved in TPS competition held within the community\r\n- Decentralization: QuarkChain has a two-layered structure and encourages individual miners with different levels of capability to mine directly without joining mining pools. People can choose to mine either in the root chain or in the shard.\r\n- Great Usability: QuarkChain supports Native token which enables each shard to have its own tokeneconomics. It also supports scalable cross-shard transactions.

The creators will get a transparent revenue share, audience data, and equal screening opportunity; the viewers will access diverse films and content, and get rewarded for providing curation, subtitles, and marketing materials to the community. Currently, more than 100 movies and dramas have been screened. In the long run, MovieBloc aims to create the largest film ecosystem centered on participants.\r\n\r\nIn February 2020, MovieBloc took over ‘Cobak’, a crypto community service in Korea and a mobile service that provides a crypto wallet, community, real-time ticker, news, airdrop, and token sale services. In Mar 2020, MovieBloc established MBL Media, a content IP development company. It will carry out IP development, production, and copyright management centered on animation and movie content as its main business. Ahn Hong-ju, one of MovieBloc’s advisor, has been appointed as CEO of MBL Media.\r\n\r\n###Launch date\r\n\r\nMovieBloc project was launched on 5 May 2019 by listing on Gate.io. MovieBloc has since listed on several exchanges such as Binance, Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Indodax, and MXC within a year. The official service was launched on 31 December 2019.\r\n\r\nPlatform MovieBloc recently moved to the Ontology mainnet.\r\n\r\n###Token Usage\r\n\r\nMBL, a MovieBloc token, is used for economic activity in the ecosystem: \r\n- Users watching premium content (TVOD)\r\n- Creators paying translators\r\n- Users donating to other participants (creators, translators)\r\n- Rewarding the users (illegal content report, film rating, film review).","links":{"website":["http://moviebloc.io/"],"technical_doc":["http://moviebloc.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/MovieBloc_White_Paper_Ver.1.14_en.pdf"],"twitter":["https://twitter.com/moviebloc"],"reddit":[],"message_board":["https://medium.com/moviebloc"],"announcement":[],"chat":["https://t.me/moviebloc","https://open.kakao.com/o/gZcn2uhb"],"explorer":["https://explorer.ont.io/token/detail/oep4/e5a49d7fd57e7178e189d3965d1ee64368a1036d/MovieBloc/10/1","https://explorer.binance.org/asset/MBL-2D2"],"source_code":[]}},{"id":1768,"coin":"ADX","name":"AdEx","slug":"adx-net","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/1768.png","description":"AdEx Network describes itself as a solution that aims to address and correct some of the most prominent inefficiencies of the online advertising industry, such as user privacy misuse, ad fraud, and lack of transparency in reporting.\r\n\r\nAdEx originated as a decentralized ad exchange and subsequently evolved into a protocol for decentralized digital advertising.

The project enables complex and intensive computations to run in a Linux environment, outside the blockchain, without compromising decentralization. Cartesi aims to make DApps significantly more powerful, easier to develop, and portable. Cartesi aims to bring mainstream scalability and convenience to developers and users of decentralized applications.\r\n\r\n###What makes Cartesi Unique?\r\n\r\nDevelopment limitations on blockchain platforms can frustrate both developers and users, turning them away. Cartesi allows developers to build on well-established software they are familiar with and running them in a Linux environment. The project aims to bridge the gap between the centralized and decentralized worlds of application development. Some of its key highlights include:\r\n\r\n- Scalability: Intensive computations on massive amounts of data are performed off-chain with the same security guarantees offered by the blockchain;\r\n- Programmability: DApp logic runs under Linux, and is coded with a choice of thousands of open-source software components available for Linux;\r\n- Ease of Adoption: Developers can work in a familiar environment with no artificial limitations and with access to all their favorite tools;\r\n- Decentralization: Consensus is securely reached on-chain with no need for a reputation protocol, Trusted Execution Environment, or servers controlled by a single party;\r\n- Portability: Cartesi aims to make DApps portable across the most important public blockchains that support smart contracts;\r\n- Privacy: DApp states can be kept private among application participants.\r\n\r\n###CTSI Overview and Use Cases\r\n\r\nCartesi aims to bring mainstream scalability and power to decentralized applications through a network of nodes. The CTSI token has been designed to incentivize Cartesi Node operators to engage with the system honestly and in an efficient way. It comprises the following use cases:\r\n\r\n- Cartesi Core: The Cartesi Core relies on an arbitration mechanism that uses CTSI as collateral to enforce honest behavior;\r\n- Cartesi Side Chain: Users of the Cartesi Side Chain pay for temporary data storage for Cartesi DApps with CTSI. Block generators receive CTSI block rewards and the fees paid by users adding data to the Side Chain;\r\n- Consensus System: CTSI is used to participate in the Side Chain's Proof-of-Stake consensus system. Miners with the highest stakes have a higher probability of being selected to generate the next block;\r\n- Data Availability Protocol: CTSI will also power a data availability protocol to aid with the transfer of large data blobs used for machine snapshots.","links":{"website":["https://cartesi.io/"],"technical_doc":["https://cartesi.io/cartesi_whitepaper.pdf"],"twitter":["https://twitter.com/cartesiproject"],"reddit":[],"message_board":["https://medium.com/cartesi"],"announcement":[],"chat":["https://t.me/cartesiproject","https://discordapp.com/invite/Pt2NrnS"],"explorer":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x491604c0fdf08347dd1fa4ee062a822a5dd06b5d","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x491604c0fdf08347dd1fa4ee062a822a5dd06b5d"],"source_code":[]}},{"id":3788,"coin":"NET","name":"NEXT","slug":"next","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/3788.png","description":"NEXT (NET) is a cryptocurrency token and operates on the Ethereum platform.

The Snapshot Chain of Vite utilizes Hierarchical Delegated Proof of Stake (“HDPoS”) to achieve network consensus, while supernodes take only staking rewards and no transaction fees. Vite virtual machine maintains compatibility with EVM, and utilizes asynchronous smart contract language, Solidity++.\r\n\r\nThe VITE token is the currency for simple token transactions and smart-contract executions on the Vite network, with users staking VITE for transaction quota instead of consuming gas. VITE can also be used to vote for Snapshot Block Producers (aka supernodes). In addition, a VITE staker with unused transaction quota can lease such quota to dApps in exchange for their tokens. For instance, users can stake VITE in exchange of ViteX’s native decentralized exchange token, VX.\r\n\r\nVite’s current products include a decentralized exchange (ViteX), a multi-purpose wallet application (Vite App), payments (VitePay), and government/enterprise blockchain applications (VitePlus):\r\n\r\n- ViteX is a decentralized exchange with on-chain orderbook and matching engine, and supports currently 20+ digital assets.\r\n- Vite App is a mobile application that allows trading (ViteX), asset management (wallet), dapps (e.g Vite-based games) in one place.\r\n- VitePay is a fast and feeless payment solution, currently available to use in Singapore’s Ce La Vi Sky Bar and taxi services under the Midwest Global network - Users can pay for merchants with Vite wallet, who in turn receive payment with zero fees with near-instant settlement. VitePay is also integrated with the e-commerce platform OpenCart, and one can utilize VitePay at the official Vite store.\r\n- VitePlus is a Vite-based enterprise blockchain solution for governments and enterprises. Vite has developed a pilot app, SyraCoin, for the Syracuse government, allowing city housing fund donors to receive blockchain-based coupons that are redeemable for goods and services within city bounds.\r\n\r\n**How can you buy or mine VITE?\r\n\r\nYou may purchase VITE at major exchanges such as Binance, OKEx, and Bittrex. To 'mine' VITE, you may run a Snapshot Block Producer (aka supernode to partake in the HDPOS consensus process) on the Vite network, and receive block rewards in the form of the annual inflation of 30 million VITE coins. You may also run a full node and receive VITE rewards from the Vite foundation.\r\n\r\n**Supply Distribution\r\n\r\nPrivate Sale tokens comprise 40.43% of total supply. It was conducted in May 2018 for 404.33MM VITE at a rate of 7,000 VITE = 1 ETH and raised a total of 57,762 ETH (~$40.43MM) at ~$0.10 per token, selling 40.43% of the total token supply.\r\n\r\n- Marketing tokens comprise 10.00% of total supply.\r\n- Ecosystem Development tokens comprise 23.57% of total supply.\r\n- Team tokens comprise 20.00% of total supply.\r\n- Airdrop tokens comprise 5.00% of total supply.\r\n- Advisor tokens comprise 1.00% of total supply.\"","links":{"website":["https://www.vite.org/"],"technical_doc":["https://vite.wiki"],"twitter":["https://twitter.com/vitelabs"],"reddit":["https://reddit.com/r/vitelabs"],"message_board":["https://medium.com/vitelabs"],"announcement":["https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4438416"],"chat":["https://t.me/vite_en","https://discordapp.com/invite/CsVY76q"],"explorer":["https://explorer.vite.net/","https://vitescan.io/","https://etherscan.io/token/0x1b793E49237758dBD8b752AFC9Eb4b329d5Da016","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x1b793E49237758dBD8b752AFC9Eb4b329d5Da016"],"source_code":["https://github.com/vitelabs"]}},{"id":1803,"coin":"PCN","name":"PeepCoin","slug":"peepcoin","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/1803.png","description":"PeepCoin (PCN) is a cryptocurrency.

It redesigns app advertising, in-app purchases (IAP), and app approval flows through a circular model. As a higher share of the advertising and IAP revenue is kept within the app ecosystem, more value is retained in the app economy. Being an open protocol, it would theoretically provide more transparency and trust. Multiple app stores can implement and benefit from this and stakeholders will have to contribute to its development and adoption. Furthermore, API integration will streamline implementation.\r\n\r\nAppCoins integrates app stores, users, developers, advertisers, and OEMs. This system is app store agnostic, existing across different mobile platforms (Android & iOS). The different app stores act as oracles of the smart contracts, which are associated with each of the platform’s core transactions. This system creates a trust layer for the economy, obviating the need for intermediaries. AppCoins aims to become the universal language of the app economy.\r\n\r\nThe protocol also includes a so-called Proof-of-Attention system. Users, app stores, and OEMs receive tokens through the Proof-of Attention concept as a reward. Developers that want to advertise their apps can be sure that the user has installed and used it. The users reinvest their tokens via inapp purchases and this would theoretically create a virtuous loop that boosts the AppCoins economic growth.\r\n\r\n- Link to the Source Code: https://github.com/AppStoreFoundation  \r\n- Chat: https://t.me/appcoinsofficial  \r\n- Announcement: https://medium.com/@appcoins \r\n- Source: Official website: https://appcoins.io","links":{"website":["https://appcoins.io/"],"technical_doc":["https://appcoins.io/assets/images/white-paper.pdf"],"twitter":["https://twitter.com/appcoinsproject"],"reddit":["https://reddit.com/r/AppcoinsProtocol"],"message_board":[],"announcement":["https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2280664.0"],"chat":[],"explorer":["https://appcexplorer.io/"],"source_code":[]}},{"id":3880,"coin":"OCE","name":"OceanEx Token","slug":"oceanex-token","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/3880.png","description":"OceanEx Token is the native exchange token for OceanEx exchange platform.

Unlike server-side backend code, smart contracts can be open for all to read, allowing users to review how their data will be transmitted before any final commitments to action.\r\n\r\n- Filesystem: Client-side code and other frontend materials can be distributed via nOS Filesystem, a decentralized file sharing protocol that reportedly allows for secure and transparent distribution of static files. \r\n\r\n- Client: Apps that are deployed to nOS can be accessed through nOS Client, a software solution for desktop and mobile that (among other features) introduces nOS Browser. nOS Browser functions as a web browser, which is integrated with the nOS Protocol, a blockchain-powered web protocol that the facilitates secure and open accessibility of nOS apps.\r\n\r\n- Protocol and Name Service: The nOS Protocol resolves domain names that exist on nOS Name Service, a blockchain-powered decentralized implementation of a Domain Name Service, and allows for apps to register domain names which are discoverable on nOS.\r\n\r\n- App Store and Decentralized Authority: The App Store aims to offer a user-friendly discovery platform.\r\n\r\n- Automatic Token Conversion: By integrating crypto-currency exchange APIs, nOS Client is reportedly able to automatically convert primary blockchain platform currencies into the required amount of application tokens that are needed to make specific transactions or invocations.","links":{"website":["https://nos.io"],"technical_doc":["https://nos.io/static/whitepaper.pdf"],"twitter":["https://twitter.com/nOSplatform"],"reddit":["https://reddit.com/r/nOSplatform"],"message_board":["https://medium.com/nos-io"],"announcement":["https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5054273"],"chat":["https://nos.chat","https://t.me/nOSchat"],"explorer":["https://neotracker.io/contract/c9c0fc5a2b66a29d6b14601e752e6e1a445e088d"],"source_code":["https://github.com/nos"]}},{"id":3712,"coin":"CLB","name":"Cloudbric","slug":"cloudbric","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/3712.png","description":"Cloudbric (CLB) is a cryptocurrency token and operates on the Ethereum platform.

Centralized storage solutions are prone to data breaches, Sharder's distributed storage network aims to solve this problem. Data is encrypted, shard (split into small fragments) and then distributed across Sharder's global storage network. Sharder's validation & authentication service aims to protect all types of digital files from fraud and manipulation. The goal is to prevent falsified medical records, work contracts, safety reports, or university degrees. Utilizing blockchain technology Sharder saves the files hash or digital fingerprint ensuring it is securely stored, immutable, and verifiable. \r\n\r\n###How does Sharder work?\r\n\r\nSS tokens are cryptocurrency embedded in the Sharder network. SS is required to pay for storage services and nodes are rewarded with SS for providing storage space and validating transactions on the network. Sharder has built its own range of hardware: The Sharder Hub is a micro node miner with built-in storage and validation capabilities. The Sharder Box provides validation, mining, and 96TB of storage space to the network. The box can be set up to dual mine other DPOS, POS & POC coins.\r\n\r\nStorage applications can be built on top of Sharder. SignEase is an electronic signature application that utilizes Sharder for the storage and validation of file hashes. Every contract stored on SignEase is validated by Sharder.

Aeron is constructing a database and an online system that is decentralized, hosting global data on aircraft, flight schools, and pilots. This electronic logging system would force pilots to have logs that reflect accurate flight hours, making aviation safer for everyone involved. Its aim is to create “airline in a pocket” — a smart blockchain-based solution. The pilot’s application is used by a pilot for personal flight logging. The company application collects and verifies data from aircraft operators, maintenance organizations, flight schools, and fixed base operators. In case of any mismatch in data between any Aeron data source with either the Air Traffic Control, pilot, or operator, aviation authorities can quickly detect and eliminate the problem. Aviation authorities can also detect any pilots operating with an expired license. \r\n\r\nAeron (ARN) utility token is incorporated in Aeron products.

Launched as an undergraduate project by Ankit Bhatia & Rob Giometti at UC Berkeley in 2017, Sapien is building a decentralized, private social network built on a foundation of independent, self-governing communities called Tribes which all participate in the SPN token economy.\r\n\r\nThe company is established on a principle of “Humans First,” which means Sapien will stand by these pledges: \r\n\r\n- Data sovereignty: as a social network, Sapien knows that privacy is paramount and will never collect personal data without consent\r\n- Self-governance: Sapien commits to give communities the tools they need to guide and protect their communities, so it will always be people who moderate and promote content, never an exploitable algorithm\r\n- Humanity: Sapien is built by humans for humans, not trolls or bots, and the platform aims to make it incredibly hard for malicious users or content to spread across the network\r\n\r\nSapien aims to build the first Web3 social network for mainstream users by building a familiar social user interface and experience and abstracting away the complexities of blockchain by implementing instant, gasless transactions for the end-user and by reinventing the wallet experience to be simpler and more intuitive.\r\n\r\nSapien aligns its business model with the best interests of its users, so its primary source of revenue is the nominal fees it applies to Charges and Rewards.\r\n\r\nWhile Sapien was originally founded in the United States by Ankit & Rob, the team itself has grown to a team of 20, globally distributed across 10 countries.\r\n\r\n### What is the SPN token and how does it work?\r\n\r\nThe SPN token is an ERC20-compliant utility token that can be used to reward and recognize valuable contributions to the communities, subscribe or purchase access to content shared by creators, and to engage in social-powered e-commerce. With the SPN token, Sapien aims to democratize the power inherent to social media - social, economic, political, technological - by decentralizing the platform controls all the way down to community leaders, rather than a boardroom and a handful of executives.\r\n\r\n### Charging\r\n\r\nOne feature that separates Sapien from other social platforms is that content sorting is governed by a system of “Charges,” which are tokenized boosts users can give to posts and comments as a reward for their quality. Charges boost the presence of posts in user feeds and reward the post creator/commenter with SPN tokens within 24 hours of the Charge being given. This process gives monetary weight to the liking system commonly employed on social platforms and will enable creators to directly connect with and receive compensation from their audiences.\r\n\r\n### Staking\r\n\r\nSapien operates on a proof-of-value protocol. Users can stake their SPN tokens using the Sapien smart contract, which progressively unlocks the tokens over the course of a calendar year. Sapien employs a “Stake Rank” system which determines the platform fees charges to users at the points of Charging and collecting rewards, with the user staking more tokens than anyone else receiving the lowest fees and fees being assigned according to Stake Rank.","links":{"website":["https://www.sapien.network/"],"technical_doc":[],"twitter":["https://twitter.com/sapien_network"],"reddit":["https://reddit.com/r/sapien"],"message_board":["https://blog.sapien.network/"],"announcement":[],"chat":["https://t.me/SapienNetwork","https://t.me/sapienannouncements"],"explorer":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x20f7a3ddf244dc9299975b4da1c39f8d5d75f05a","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x20f7a3ddf244dc9299975b4da1c39f8d5d75f05a"],"source_code":["https://github.com/SapienNetwork"]}},{"id":2958,"coin":"TRTL","name":"TurtleCoin","slug":"turtlecoin","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/2958.png","description":"TurtleCoin (TRTL) is a cryptocurrency.

Traditional P2P file-sharing and networks offer no incentives for seeders and as a result, low file availability and slow downloading speeds are frequent issues. By incentivizing seeding, Upfiring aims to create a healthier file-sharing network that allows content creators and seeders to be rewarded directly for sharing content without any third-party intermediaries. \r\n\r\nUpfiring’s first usable dapp prototype launched on mainnet in December 2018, with their full application launching on 5 February 2019. The dapp is cross-platform - available for Windows, MacOS, and Linux. The application allows users to generate encrypted .ufr files with embedded price data and seed them on the Upfiring network. Users earn UFR tokens in exchange for seeding and keeping files online. Seeder smart contracts deployed to the Ethereum network mediate the movement of files across the network, maintain seeder UFR balances and allow for the decryption of files when warranted.\r\n\r\nUpfiring targets content-creators by allowing them to promote their content directly to users without relying on any third-party intermediaries.

The MEET.ONE team aims to empower traditional internet companies by helping them to integrate their business with the blockchain so that users will be able to monetize and exchange the value that they create easily, securely, and freely. \r\n\r\nIn 2019, the team plans to incubate 1-2 projects (with millions of users) that intend to move their businesses onto the MEET.ONE chain. In Q2-2020, the goal is to have over 10M on-chain accounts. The MEET.ONE wallet supports different public blockchains such as EOS and Binance, MEET.ONE, and Cosmos. Additionally, the plan is to allow users to manage, trade, and stake their assets, as well as access dApps and blockchain news. MEET.ONE wallet aims to become a portal for new users to experience the MEET.ONE blockchain. \r\n\r\nThe MEET.ONE team reportedly raised several million dollars in a private sale in 2018 to cover operating expenses for the subsequent 3 years. They were reportedly able to breakeven in November of 2018. The team's self-reported circulating supply is approximately 5B, of which 1B has been locked up on the MEET.ONE chain and re-deployed on the Binance chain.","links":{"website":["https://meet.one"],"technical_doc":[],"twitter":["https://twitter.com/MeetDotOne"],"reddit":[],"message_board":["https://medium.com/@MEET.ONE","https://steemit.com/@meetone"],"announcement":[],"chat":["https://t.me/MeetOneEnglish"],"explorer":["https://bloks.io/account/eosiomeetone","https://explorer.binance.org/asset/MEETONE-031"],"source_code":["https://github.com/meet-one/documentation"]}},{"id":4182,"coin":"GMAT","name":"GoWithMi","slug":"gowithmi","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/4182.png","description":"GoWithMi aims to map the world on the blockchain by building a global decentralized location-based services infrastructure for applications.","links":{"website":["https://www.gowithmi.com/"],"technical_doc":["http://image.gowithmi.com/cn/whitepaper.pdf"],"twitter":["https://twitter.com/GoWithMi_GL"],"reddit":[],"message_board":[],"announcement":["https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5090322"],"chat":["https://t.me/gowithmi_en","https://t.me/GoWithMi"],"explorer":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xa110eeebc0751407bdcaea4cd230f04a2b82a33a","https://explorer.binance.org/asset/GMAT-FC8"],"source_code":["https://github.com/GoWithMi"]}},{"id":3732,"coin":"CCX","name":"Conceal","slug":"conceal","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/3732.png","description":"Conceal.Network is a decentralized blockchain bank with deposits and investments paying interest rates. \r\n Conceal.Network reportedly enables untraceable, anonymous messaging, and a secure way to transfer funds.

It was developed with the goal of offering total transparency and fast/cheap transactions. Lunes' blockchain is prepared to store and guarantee the security of any kind of information, viz. document authenticity records, digital asset issuance, and execution of smart contracts.\r\n\r\nOn the Lunes' blockchain, the generation time of the key block occurs every 60 seconds; the micro-blocks take a few seconds. It reportedly has the maximum capacity of 65,500 transactions per minute and 1,092 per second. The validation of transactions on the Lunes network occurs through the LPoS (Leased Proof-of-Stake), which the Lunes team believes to be the safest validation scheme for blockchain.\r\n\r\nIn Leased Proof-of-Stake any network participant - who owns more than 5000 Lunes - can become a validator node, contributing to the security and gaining a share of network transaction fees as a reward.

The team claims that variable block-times allow Verium to scale automatically while enhancing transaction speeds and network capacity to ensure high levels of network security at any level of mining throughput. By linking the binary chain and Verium’s auxiliary mining protocol (AuxPOW), Verium will also process VeriCoin blocks. This protocol reportedly speeds up VeriCoin’s block-time to less than 30 seconds. These technologies reportedly enable VeriCoin’s network to provide an efficient and scalable system for consumer transactions. \r\n\r\nThe Dual Blockchain (or Binary-Chain) pairs a digital currency (VeriCoin) with a digital reserve (Verium). It aims to secure and accelerate transactions by leveraging complementary protocol technologies (Proof-of-Stake-Time and Proof-of-Work-Time) into a blockchain system. The goal is to offer a comprehensive solution to ensure low cost, secure, fast, and scalable digital transactions.","links":{"website":["http://www.vericoin.info/veriumlaunch.html"],"technical_doc":["https://cdn.vericonomy.com/documents/VeriCoinPoSTWhitePaper10May2015.pdf"],"twitter":["https://twitter.com/VeriumReserve"],"reddit":[],"message_board":[],"announcement":["https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1540023.0"],"chat":[],"explorer":["https://chainz.cryptoid.info/vrm/","http://explorer.vrm.vericoin.info/"],"source_code":["https://github.com/VeriumReserve"]}},{"id":181,"coin":"ZEIT","name":"Zeitcoin","slug":"zeitcoin","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/181.png","description":"Zeitcoin (ZEIT) is a cryptocurrency.

These settings reportedly reduce the chances of being identified and traced by blockchain statistical analysis. The Ryo developers implemented a uniform transaction ID system that hides the use of payment IDs because all transactions now have a uniform ID that is retrofitted with the old payment ID system. The team claims that Ryo is the first amongst various Cryptonote currencies to implement this feature, which addresses the metadata leak that reportedly affects Cryptonote coins with payment IDs. \r\n\r\nRyo aims to function as a store of value that is suitable for highly confidential transactions. The core mission of the project is to deliver a currency with true fungibility. This means that each coin is equal and interchangeable; the team claims that it is highly unlikely that any coin can ever by blacklisted due to previous transactions.","links":{"website":["https://ryo-currency.com/"],"technical_doc":[],"twitter":["https://twitter.com/RyocurrencyO"],"reddit":["https://reddit.com/r/ryocurrency"],"message_board":["https://medium.com/@ryo.currency"],"announcement":["https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4413010.0"],"chat":["https://t.me/ryocurrency","https://discord.gg/GFQmFtx"],"explorer":["https://explorer.ryo-currency.com/"],"source_code":["https://github.com/ryo-currency/ryo-currency"]}},{"id":5002,"coin":"SCAP","name":"SafeCapital","slug":"safecapital","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/5002.png","description":"Launched on 11/11/2019, SafeCapital aims to roll investment modules in one single ecosystem.

Neutron uses the Proof Of Stake consensus algorithm, which allows users to \"stake\" their holdings to generate a passive income in the form of newly-minted Neutron, with no special hardware and very little processing power. \r\n\r\nNeutron features masternode technology that enables a client to receive a higher percentage reward for locking in collateral (25,000 coins). The more Neutron is held in a staking wallet, the higher the weight a client has vis-a-vis the network, which determines the average time in which a block is solved. Neutron also features a Dynamic Reward Reduction with no \"Hard\" \"Halving\" event -  the amount of Daily Neutron created reduces gradually over every one million blocks. \r\n\r\nNeutron is managed and maintained by BitlabLLC out of Arlington Texas, by Theron Rodriguez and Thomas Dowdy, with Thomas Posey (Ok), Rick Caceres (CAN), Adam Waldenberg (Sweden), Jason Hickson (Texas), Eron Villareal (Japan). Neutron's goal is to be usable as an everyday currency via a card-based payment gateway or mobile app service directly from a linked Neutron Wallet.","links":{"website":["http://www.neutroncoin.com/"],"technical_doc":["https://www.neutroncoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Nucleus-Paper-v2.pdf"],"twitter":["https://twitter.com/Neutron_Crypto"],"reddit":["https://reddit.com/r/NeutronCoin"],"message_board":[],"announcement":["https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1323468"],"chat":["https://t.me/NeutronCoin","https://discord.gg/NuGTB6z"],"explorer":["http://ntrn.explorer.cryptotools.pw:3001/","http://www.fuzzbawls.pw/explore/Neutron/","http://www.presstab.pw/phpexplorer/NTRN/index.php"],"source_code":["https://github.com/neutroncoin/neutron"]}},{"id":2255,"coin":"SEND","name":"Social Send","slug":"social-send","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/2255.png","description":"Social Send (SEND) is a cryptocurrency.

Anonymous) describes itself as a cryptocurrency with privacy and masternode features that aims to build upon Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency technologies. The team includes Jake Greenbaum (Jake the CryptoKing) as its founder and advisors such as Steven Nerayoff, Eli Blatt, and Ran Neu-Ner. Similar to cash, ANON reportedly allows the payer and payee to remain anonymous while transacting - Users can selectively anonymize transactions that are made over the network using zk-SNARKs. \r\n\r\nAccording to the team, ANON's shielded addresses keep balances and transactions private and untrackable. Balances and transactions can also be made transparent by using the unshielded addresses. This allows the network to maintain a secure ledger of balances without disclosing the users or amounts involved. Instead of publishing spend-authority and transaction values, the transaction metadata is encrypted and zk-SNARKs are used to prove the integrity of balances and coin supply.\r\n\r\nANON rewards its masternode operators with a portion of the block rewards and allows operators voting rights on community-raised proposals. Proposals can be made by anyone upon payment of 100 ANON, and once passed, these proposals direct the payment of superblocks to fund tertiary initiatives. Although developmental pathing decisions rest with the team, the community is able to directly influence the project via the proposals and voting process.Following the coin-burn in January 2019, there will be a maximum of 20,228,644 ANON that will ever exist, making it a deflationary currency.

It aims to offer all advantages of a public blockchain: immutability, transparency, transaction capability. Additionally, embedding a virtual machine (VM), it makes it a platform to host Turing complete code (smart contracts). It is the bridge that connects applied technology and real-world markets based on blockchain. It aims to offer a brand-new solution for the economy and businesses. ECOChain was initiated by an international blockchain team that uses blockchain technology as a basis to explore the integration of the global economic market and the blockchain world and also build a global decentralized distributed ecosystem. \r\n\r\n### What is the Value of ECOChain?\r\n\r\nECOChain is a decentralized public blockchain which aims to provide security and scalability, running Proof-of-Stake consensus and supporting smart contracts by using Virtual Machine (VM) as executor. Moreover, it reportedly offers high transaction speeds (560 TPS) & short block creation times (32 seconds) for faster confirmation of transactions. ECOChain aims to work as the bridge which connects applied technology and real-world markets on blockchain technology. \r\n\r\n### How do you mine ECOC?\r\n\r\nECOC is based on a Proof-of-Stake system (PoS) which encourages more nodes to take part in the consensus algorithm and makes blockchain more decentralized as it has no mining cartels. Blocks are created on the blockchain every 32 seconds and a winning node receives 50 ECOCs as a block reward. Staking is necessary to motivate coin holders to run a full node. Running a node decentralizes it and makes it more secure. There is a small cost to run a node (server cost), so the reward must be greater than this. The staking reward is also a compensation for the risk of the investor.\r\n\r\n### How do you buy ECOC?\r\n\r\nYou can buy ECOC through any cryptocurrency exchange that supports ECOC or visit (http://ecoc.io) to see the list of trading venues for this asset.","links":{"website":["https://ecoc.io/"],"technical_doc":["https://ecoc.io/wp-content/uploads/docs/white-paper.pdf"],"twitter":["https://twitter.com/EcocBlockchain"],"reddit":[],"message_board":[],"announcement":[],"chat":["https://t.me/ecochainCN"],"explorer":["https://explorer.ecoc.io/"],"source_code":["https://github.com/ECO-chain/ecochain"]}},{"id":6037,"coin":"LINKBULL","name":"3X Long Chainlink Token","slug":"3x-long-chainlink-token","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/6037.png","description":"FTX Leveraged tokens are ERC20 & BEP2 tokens that have leveraged exposure to crypto.
