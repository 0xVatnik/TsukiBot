It redesigns app advertising, in-app purchases (IAP), and app approval flows through a circular model. As a higher share of the advertising and IAP revenue is kept within the app ecosystem, more value is retained in the app economy. Being an open protocol, it would theoretically provide more transparency and trust. Multiple app stores can implement and benefit from this and stakeholders will have to contribute to its development and adoption. Furthermore, API integration will streamline implementation.\r\n\r\nAppCoins integrates app stores, users, developers, advertisers, and OEMs. This system is app store agnostic, existing across different mobile platforms (Android & iOS). The different app stores act as oracles of the smart contracts, which are associated with each of the platform’s core transactions. This system creates a trust layer for the economy, obviating the need for intermediaries. AppCoins aims to become the universal language of the app economy.\r\n\r\nThe protocol also includes a so-called Proof-of-Attention system. Users, app stores, and OEMs receive tokens through the Proof-of Attention concept as a reward. Developers that want to advertise their apps can be sure that the user has installed and used it. The users reinvest their tokens via inapp purchases and this would theoretically create a virtuous loop that boosts the AppCoins economic growth.\r\n\r\n- Link to the Source Code: https://github.com/AppStoreFoundation  \r\n- Chat: https://t.me/appcoinsofficial  \r\n- Announcement: https://medium.com/@appcoins \r\n- Source: Official website: https://appcoins.io"},{"coin":"UTNP","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/2524.png","description":null},{"coin":"BTCP","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/2575.png","description":"Created in Mar 2018, Bitcoin Private (BTCP) is a community-driven cryptocurrency that was forked from Zclassic and Bitcoin.

Instead, each agent in the public blockchain maintains a private fork that is managed and stored in a limited way on the public blockchain with a distributed hash table. This enables every device on a network to function independently, and only requires the synchronization of data when necessary, or agreed upon by users. This could translate into higher scalability for dapps hosted on Holochain. The Holo ecosystem relies on hosts that provide processing and storage for distributed applications while earning redeemable credits.

The mission is to provide a blockchain-agnostic platform for building dapps.\r\n\r\nZXC (fungible ERC-20 token) is the native utility token of the 0xcert protocol and was introduced to align issuing parties with dapps and the community. With the infrastructure built around the system of smart contracts, its primary role is to provide the incentive mechanisms and support the ecosystem with low fees.\r\n\r\nMore information can be found at the 0xcert website (https://0xcert.org/), GitHub (https://www.github.com/0xcert/framework), and the Framework Documentation (https://docs.0xcert.org)."},{"coin":"PUT","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/2419.png","description":null},{"coin":"THRT","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/2899.png","description":null},{"coin":"XSH","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/2144.png","description":null},{"coin":"ACAT","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/2525.png","description":null},{"coin":"PAT","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/2759.png","description":null},{"coin":"UQC","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/2273.png","description":null},{"coin":"DOPE","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/145.png","description":null},{"coin":"NBC","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/3095.png","description":null},{"coin":"NIO","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/2151.png","description":null},{"coin":"TAC","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/3227.png","description":null},{"coin":"MVP","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/2869.png","description":null},{"coin":"COFI","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/2478.png","description":null},{"coin":"SVD","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/3161.png","description":null},{"coin":"INVE","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/3597.png","description":null},{"coin":"OWC","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/3763.png","description":"Oduwa Coin (OWC) describes itself as a digital payment ecosystem that is built on the foundation of a hybrid POW/POS algorithm."},{"coin":"FMF","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/3028.png","description":null},{"coin":"LABX","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/3751.png","description":"Established in 2017 in Germany, Stakinglab was launched with an objective to offer a comprehensive platform to investors and project owners for Proof of Stake coins, masternode coins, and other relevant services.
