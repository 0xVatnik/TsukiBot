It redesigns app advertising, in-app purchases (IAP), and app approval flows through a circular model. As a higher share of the advertising and IAP revenue is kept within the app ecosystem, more value is retained in the app economy. Being an open protocol, it would theoretically provide more transparency and trust. Multiple app stores can implement and benefit from this and stakeholders will have to contribute to its development and adoption. Furthermore, API integration will streamline implementation.\r\n\r\nAppCoins integrates app stores, users, developers, advertisers, and OEMs. This system is app store agnostic, existing across different mobile platforms (Android & iOS). The different app stores act as oracles of the smart contracts, which are associated with each of the platform’s core transactions. This system creates a trust layer for the economy, obviating the need for intermediaries. AppCoins aims to become the universal language of the app economy.\r\n\r\nThe protocol also includes a so-called Proof-of-Attention system. Users, app stores, and OEMs receive tokens through the Proof-of Attention concept as a reward. Developers that want to advertise their apps can be sure that the user has installed and used it. The users reinvest their tokens via inapp purchases and this would theoretically create a virtuous loop that boosts the AppCoins economic growth.\r\n\r\n- Link to the Source Code: https://github.com/AppStoreFoundation  \r\n- Chat: https://t.me/appcoinsofficial  \r\n- Announcement: https://medium.com/@appcoins \r\n- Source: Official website: https://appcoins.io"},{"coin":"AVA","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/2776.png","description":"Travala.com (AVA) is a cryptocurrency token and operates on the NEO platform.

Key features include:\r\n\r\n- Infinity Nodes to allow for the instantaneous sending of SIN coins, which is carried out through FlashSend. Users will have the option to send their SINOVATE coins anonymously, via a feature known as ShadowSend.\r\n\r\n- Revolving Sovereignty Votes(RSV) aims to offer the most decentralized E-Governance voting system. Those who want to vote must keep having new nodes whenever their maturity date is reached. IDS, which will allow users to send encrypted data anonymously, will eventually be implemented.\r\n\r\n- Infinity Nodes and the coins that are set up for nodes will be removed from the circulating supply to control inflation whilst continuing to support, validate and secure the network. The incentive rate received is dependent on the number of locked in an Infinity Node. All Infinity Nodes will have a theoretical life of 12 months, at which point they will be removed from the node count.

Traditional P2P file-sharing and networks offer no incentives for seeders and as a result, low file availability and slow downloading speeds are frequent issues. By incentivizing seeding, Upfiring aims to create a healthier file-sharing network that allows content creators and seeders to be rewarded directly for sharing content without any third-party intermediaries. \r\n\r\nUpfiring’s first usable dapp prototype launched on mainnet in December 2018, with their full application launching on 5 February 2019. The dapp is cross-platform - available for Windows, MacOS, and Linux. The application allows users to generate encrypted .ufr files with embedded price data and seed them on the Upfiring network. Users earn UFR tokens in exchange for seeding and keeping files online. Seeder smart contracts deployed to the Ethereum network mediate the movement of files across the network, maintain seeder UFR balances and allow for the decryption of files when warranted.\r\n\r\nUpfiring targets content-creators by allowing them to promote their content directly to users without relying on any third-party intermediaries. UFR tokens are used within the dapp to unlock encrypted content. The dapp can be downloaded from https://www.upfiring.com, and the corresponding documentation can be found at: https://www.upfiring.com/documentation.html"},{"coin":"PRE","logo":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/2245.png","description":"Presearch (PRE) is a cryptocurrency token and operates on the Ethereum platform.

Registered protein folding participants continue to receive distributions from the 'automated oracle' at Cryptobullionpools.com, with the premine balance cached in cold storage (visible on block explorers). The network has transitioned to pure Proof-of-Stake (averaging ~10% rewards annually), which works to secure Curecoin's network. \r\n\r\nThe Curecoin system leverages Stanford's* Folding@home distributed research software. As of 1 May 2019, Curecoin's folding team is ranked #1 on the global Folding@home network.

These settings reportedly reduce the chances of being identified and traced by blockchain statistical analysis. The Ryo developers implemented a uniform transaction ID system that hides the use of payment IDs because all transactions now have a uniform ID that is retrofitted with the old payment ID system. The team claims that Ryo is the first amongst various Cryptonote currencies to implement this feature, which addresses the metadata leak that reportedly affects Cryptonote coins with payment IDs. \r\n\r\nRyo aims to function as a store of value that is suitable for highly confidential transactions. The core mission of the project is to deliver a currency with true fungibility.

The team claims that variable block-times allow Verium to scale automatically while enhancing transaction speeds and network capacity to ensure high levels of network security at any level of mining throughput. By linking the binary chain and Verium’s auxiliary mining protocol (AuxPOW), Verium will also process VeriCoin blocks. This protocol reportedly speeds up VeriCoin’s block-time to less than 30 seconds. These technologies reportedly enable VeriCoin’s network to provide an efficient and scalable system for consumer transactions. \r\n\r\nThe Dual Blockchain (or Binary-Chain) pairs a digital currency (VeriCoin) with a digital reserve (Verium).

Anonymous) describes itself as a cryptocurrency with privacy and masternode features that aims to build upon Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency technologies. The team includes Jake Greenbaum (Jake the CryptoKing) as its founder and advisors such as Steven Nerayoff, Eli Blatt, and Ran Neu-Ner. Similar to cash, ANON reportedly allows the payer and payee to remain anonymous while transacting - Users can selectively anonymize transactions that are made over the network using zk-SNARKs. \r\n\r\nAccording to the team, ANON's shielded addresses keep balances and transactions private and untrackable. Balances and transactions can also be made transparent by using the unshielded addresses. This allows the network to maintain a secure ledger of balances without disclosing the users or amounts involved. Instead of publishing spend-authority and transaction values, the transaction metadata is encrypted and zk-SNARKs are used to prove the integrity of balances and coin supply.\r\n\r\nANON rewards its masternode operators with a portion of the block rewards and allows operators voting rights on community-raised proposals. Proposals can be made by anyone upon payment of 100 ANON, and once passed, these proposals direct the payment of superblocks to fund tertiary initiatives. Although developmental pathing decisions rest with the team, the community is able to directly influence the project via the proposals and voting process.Following the coin-burn in January 2019, there will be a maximum of 20,228,644 ANON that will ever exist, making it a deflationary currency.
